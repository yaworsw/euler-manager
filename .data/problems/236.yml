  'A' and 'B' provided the following numbers of products for the luxury hamper market:\n\n<center><table
  class=\"p236\">\r\n<tr>\n<th>Product</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">'A'</th>\n<th
  style=\"text-align:center\">'B'</th>\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\n<td>Beluga Caviar</td>\n<td>5248</td>\n<td>640</td>\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\n<td>Christmas
  Cake</td>\n<td>1312</td>\n<td>1888</td>\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\n<td>Gammon Joint</td>\n<td>2624</td>\n<td>3776</td>\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\n<td>Vintage
  Port</td>\n<td>5760</td>\n<td>3776</td>\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\n<td>Champagne Truffles</td>\n<td>3936</td>\n<td>5664</td>\n</tr>\r\n</table></center>\n\nAlthough
  the suppliers try very hard to ship their goods in perfect condition, there is inevitably
  some spoilage - _i.e._ products gone bad.\n\nThe suppliers compare their performance
  using two types of statistic:\n\n- The five _per-product spoilage rates_ for each
  supplier are equal to the number of products gone bad divided by the number of products
  supplied, for each of the five products in turn.\n- The _overall spoilage rate_
  for each supplier is equal to the total number of products gone bad divided by the
  total number of products provided by that supplier.\n\nTo their surprise, the suppliers
  found that each of the five per-product spoilage rates was worse (higher) for 'B'
  than for 'A' by the same factor (ratio of spoilage rates), <var>m</var>>1; and yet,
  paradoxically, the overall spoilage rate was worse for 'A' than for 'B', also by
  a factor of <var>m</var>.\n\nThere are thirty-five <var>m</var> ![>]({{ images_dir
  }}/symbol_gt.gif)1 for which this surprising result could have occurred, the smallest
  of which is 1476/1475.\n\nWhat's the largest possible value of <var>m</var>?  \n\rGive
  your answer as a fraction reduced to its lowest terms, in the form <var>u</var>/<var>v</var>.\n\n"
