:name: Exploring strings for which only one character comes lexicographically after
  its neighbour to the left
:url: http://projecteuler.net/problem=158
:content: "Taking three different letters from the 26 letters of the alphabet, character
  strings of length three can be formed.  \n\rExamples are 'abc', 'hat' and 'zyx'.
  \ \n\rWhen we study these three examples we see that for 'abc' two characters come
  lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.  \n \rFor 'hat' there is exactly
  one character that comes lexicographically after its neighbour to the left. For
  'zyx' there are zero characters that come lexicographically after its neighbour
  to the left.  \n\rIn all there are 10400 strings of length 3 for which exactly one
  character comes lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.\n\nWe now consider
  strings of <var>n</var> ![≤]({{ images_dir }}/symbol_le.gif) 26 different characters
  from the alphabet.  \n \rFor every <var>n</var>, p(<var>n</var>) is the number of
  strings of length <var>n</var> for which exactly one character comes lexicographically
  after its neighbour to the left.\n\nWhat is the maximum value of p(<var>n</var>)?\n\n"
