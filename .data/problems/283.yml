:name: Integer sided triangles for which the area/perimeter ratio is integral
:url: http://projecteuler.net/problem=283
:content: "Consider the triangle with sides 6, 8 and 10. It can be seen that the perimeter
  and the area are both equal to 24. \rSo the area/perimeter ratio is equal to 1.
  \ \n\rConsider also the triangle with sides 13, 14 and 15. The perimeter equals
  42 while the area is equal to 84. \rSo for this triangle the area/perimeter ratio
  is equal to 2.\n\nFind the sum of the perimeters of all integer sided triangles
  for which the area/perimeter ratios are equal to positive integers not exceeding
  1000.\n\n"
