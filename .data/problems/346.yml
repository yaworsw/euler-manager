:content: "The number 7 is special, because 7 is 111 written in base 2, and 11 written
  in base 6   \n(i.e. 7<sub>10</sub> = 11<sub>6</sub> = 111<sub>2</sub>). In other
  words, 7 is a repunit in at least two bases b > 1.\n\nWe shall call a positive integer
  with this property a strong repunit. It can be verified that there are 8 strong
  repunits below 50: {1,7,13,15,21,31,40,43}.   \nFurthermore, the sum of all strong
  repunits below 1000 equals 15864.\n\n\rFind the sum of all strong repunits below
  10<sup>12</sup>.\r\r\r\r\n"
