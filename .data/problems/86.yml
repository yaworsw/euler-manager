:content: "A spider, S, sits in one corner of a cuboid room, measuring 6 by 5 by 3,
  and a fly, F, sits in the opposite corner. By travelling on the surfaces of the
  room the shortest \"straight line\" distance from S to F is 10 and the path is shown
  on the diagram.\n\n ![]({{ images_dir }}/p_086.gif)  \n\nHowever, there are up to
  three \"shortest\" path candidates for any given cuboid and the shortest route doesn't
  always have integer length.\n\nBy considering all cuboid rooms with integer dimensions,
  up to a maximum size of M by M by M, there are exactly 2060 cuboids for which the
  shortest route has integer length when M=100, and this is the least value of M for
  which the number of solutions first exceeds two thousand; the number of solutions
  is 1975 when M=99.\n\nFind the least value of M such that the number of solutions
  first exceeds one million.\n\n"
