:content: "For any set A of numbers, let sum(A) be the sum of the elements of A.  \n\rConsider
  the set B = {1,3,6,8,10,11}.  \n There are 20 subsets of B containing three elements,
  and their sums are:\n\nsum({1,3,6}) = 10,  \n\rsum({1,3,8}) = 12,  \n\rsum({1,3,10})
  = 14,  \n\rsum({1,3,11}) = 15,  \n\rsum({1,6,8}) = 15,  \n\rsum({1,6,10}) = 17,
  \ \n\rsum({1,6,11}) = 18,  \n\rsum({1,8,10}) = 19,  \n\rsum({1,8,11}) = 20,  \n\rsum({1,10,11})
  = 22,  \n\rsum({3,6,8}) = 17,  \n\rsum({3,6,10}) = 19,  \n\rsum({3,6,11}) = 20,
  \ \n\rsum({3,8,10}) = 21,  \n\rsum({3,8,11}) = 22,  \n\rsum({3,10,11}) = 24,  \n\rsum({6,8,10})
  = 24,  \n\rsum({6,8,11}) = 25,  \n\rsum({6,10,11}) = 27,  \n\rsum({8,10,11}) = 29.\n\nSome
  of these sums occur more than once, others are unique.  \n\rFor a set A, let U(A,k)
  be the set of unique sums of k-element subsets of A, in our example we find U(B,3)
  = {10,12,14,18,21,25,27,29} and sum(U(B,3)) = 156.\n\nNow consider the 100-element
  set S = {1<sup>2</sup>, 2<sup>2</sup>, ... , 100<sup>2</sup>}.  \n\rS has 100891344545564193334812497256
  50-element subsets.\n\nDetermine the sum of all integers which are the sum of exactly
  one of the 50-element subsets of S, i.e. find sum(U(S,50)).\n\n"
