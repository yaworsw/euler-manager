:name: Coded triangle numbers
:content: "\r\n<p>The <i>n</i><sup>th</sup> term of the sequence of triangle numbers
  is given by, <i>t<sub>n</sub></i> = ½<i>n</i>(<i>n</i>+1); so the first ten triangle
  numbers are:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36,
  45, 55, ...</p>\r\n<p>By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding
  to its alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For example,
  the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = <i>t</i><sub>10</sub>. If the word
  value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.</p>\r\n<p>Using

  triangle words?</p>\r\n"
