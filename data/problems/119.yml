:content: "\r\n<p>The number 512 is interesting because it is equal to the sum of
  its digits raised to some power: 5 + 1 + 2 = 8, and 8<sup>3</sup> = 512. Another
  example of a number with this property is 614656 = 28<sup>4</sup>.</p>\r\n<p>We
  shall define <i>a</i><sub>n</sub> to be the <i>n</i>th term of this sequence and
  insist that a number must contain at least two digits to have a sum.</p>\r\n<p>You
  are given that <i>a</i><sub>2</sub> = 512 and <i>a</i><sub>10</sub> = 614656.</p>\r\n<p>Find
  <i>a</i><sub>30</sub>.</p>\r\n\r\n"
