:content:
- 'The number 512 is interesting because it is equal to the sum of its digits raised
  to some power: 5 + 1 + 2 = 8, and 8<sup>3</sup> = 512. Another example of a number
  with this property is 614656 = 28<sup>4</sup>.'
- We shall define <i>a</i><sub>n</sub> to be the <i>n</i>th term of this sequence
  and insist that a number must contain at least two digits to have a sum.
- You are given that <i>a</i><sub>2</sub> = 512 and <i>a</i><sub>10</sub> = 614656.
- Find <i>a</i><sub>30</sub>.
