- "\r\nAn ant moves on a regular grid of squares that are coloured either black or
  white.<br> \r\nThe ant is always oriented in one of the cardinal directions (left,
  right, up or down) and moves from square to adjacent square according to the following
  rules:<br>\r\n- if it is on a black square, it flips the color of the square to
  white, rotates 90 degrees counterclockwise and moves forward one square.<br>\r\n-
  if it is on a white square, it flips the color of the square to black, rotates 90
  degrees clockwise and moves forward one square.<br>"
- "\r\nStarting with a grid that is entirely white, how many squares are black after
  10<sup>18</sup> moves of the ant?\r\n"
