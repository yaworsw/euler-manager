:content: "\r\n<p>\r\nAn ant moves on a regular grid of squares that are coloured
  either black or white.<br> \r\nThe ant is always oriented in one of the cardinal
  directions (left, right, up or down) and moves from square to adjacent square according
  to the following rules:<br>\r\n- if it is on a black square, it flips the color
  of the square to white, rotates 90 degrees counterclockwise and moves forward one
  square.<br>\r\n- if it is on a white square, it flips the color of the square to
  black, rotates 90 degrees clockwise and moves forward one square.<br></p>\r\n<p>\r\nStarting
  with a grid that is entirely white, how many squares are black after 10<sup>18</sup>
  moves of the ant?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n"
