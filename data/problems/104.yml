:content:
- 'The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:'
- It turns out that F<sub>541</sub>, which contains 113 digits, is the first Fibonacci
  number for which the last nine digits are 1-9 pandigital (contain all the digits
  1 to 9, but not necessarily in order). And F<sub>2749</sub>, which contains 575
  digits, is the first Fibonacci number for which the first nine digits are 1-9 pandigital.
- Given that F<sub><i>k</i></sub> is the first Fibonacci number for which the first
  nine digits AND the last nine digits are 1-9 pandigital, find <i>k</i>.
