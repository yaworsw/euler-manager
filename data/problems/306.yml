:content: "The following game is a classic example of Combinatorial Game Theory:\n\nTwo
  players start with a strip of <var>n</var> white squares and they take alternate
  turns.  \n\rOn each turn, a player picks two contiguous white squares and paints
  them black.  \n\rThe first player who cannot make a move loses.\n\n- If <var>n</var>
  = 1, there are no valid moves, so the first player loses automatically.\n- If <var>n</var>
  = 2, there is only one valid move, after which the second player loses.\n- If <var>n</var>
  = 3, there are two valid moves, but both leave a situation where the second player
  loses.\n- If <var>n</var> = 4, there are three valid moves for the first player;
  she can win the game by painting the two middle squares.\n- If <var>n</var> = 5,
  there are four valid moves for the first player (shown below in red); but no matter
  what she does, the second player (blue) wins.\n\n ![]({{ images_dir }}/p_306_pstrip.gif)\n\nSo,
  for 1 ![≤]({{ images_dir }}/symbol_le.gif) <var>n</var> ![≤]({{ images_dir }}/symbol_le.gif)
  5, there are 3 values of <var>n</var> for which the first player can force a win.
  \ \n\rSimilarly, for 1 ![≤]({{ images_dir }}/symbol_le.gif) <var>n</var> ![≤]({{
  images_dir }}/symbol_le.gif) 50, there are 40 values of <var>n</var> for which the
  first player can force a win.\n\nFor 1 ![≤]({{ images_dir }}/symbol_le.gif) <var>n</var>
  ![≤]({{ images_dir }}/symbol_le.gif) 1 000 000, how many values of <var>n</var>
  are there for which the first player can force a win?\n\n"
