:content: "If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four,
  five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.\n\nIf all the
  numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many
  letters would be used?\n\n  \n\n**NOTE:** Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example,
  342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen)
  contains 20 letters. The use of \"and\" when writing out numbers is in compliance
  with British usage.\n\n"
