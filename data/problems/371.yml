:content: "\r\n<p>\r\nOregon licence plates consist of three letters followed by a
  three digit number (each digit can be from [0..9]).<br>\r\nWhile driving to work
  Seth plays the following game:<br>\r\nWhenever the numbers of two licence plates
  seen on his trip add to 1000 that's a win.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nE.g. MIC-012 and HAN-988
  is a win and RYU-500 and SET-500 too. (as long as he sees them in the same trip).
  \r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nFind the expected number of plates he needs to see
  for a win.<br>\r\nGive your answer rounded to 8 decimal places behind the decimal
  point.\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size:88%\">\r\n<b>Note:</b> We assume that each
  licence plate seen is equally likely to have any three digit number on it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
