:content: "Consider an equilateral triangle in which straight lines are drawn from
  each vertex to the middle of the opposite side, such as in the _size 1_ triangle
  in the sketch below.\n\n ![](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/p_163.gif)\n\nSixteen
  triangles of either different shape or size or orientation or location can now be
  observed in that triangle. Using _size 1_ triangles as building blocks, larger triangles
  can be formed, such as the _size 2_ triangle in the above sketch. One-hundred and
  four triangles of either different shape or size or orientation or location can
  now be observed in that _size 2_ triangle.\n\nIt can be observed that the _size
  2_ triangle contains 4 _size 1_ triangle building blocks. A _size 3_ triangle would
  contain 9 _size 1_ triangle building blocks and a _size n_ triangle would thus contain
  _n<sup>2</sup> size 1_ triangle building blocks.\n\nIf we denote T(<var>n</var>)
  as the number of triangles present in a triangle of _size <var>n</var>_, then\n\nT(1)
  = 16  \n\rT(2) = 104\n\nFind T(36).\n\n"
