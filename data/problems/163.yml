:content: "\r\n<p>Consider an equilateral triangle in which straight lines are drawn
  from each vertex to the middle of the opposite side, such as in the <i>size 1</i>
  triangle in the sketch below.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"project/images/p_163.gif\"
  width=\"300\" height=\"200\" alt=\"\"></div>\r\n<p>Sixteen triangles of either different
  shape or size or orientation or location can now be observed in that triangle. Using
  <i>size 1</i> triangles as building blocks, larger triangles can be formed, such
  as the <i>size 2</i> triangle in the above sketch. One-hundred and four triangles
  of either different shape or size or orientation or location can now be observed
  in that <i>size 2</i> triangle.</p>\r\n<p>It can be observed that the <i>size 2</i>
  triangle contains 4 <i>size 1</i> triangle building blocks. A <i>size 3</i> triangle
  would contain 9 <i>size 1</i> triangle building blocks and a <i>size n</i> triangle
  would thus contain <i>n<sup>2</sup> size 1</i> triangle building blocks.</p>\r\n<p>If
  we denote T(<var>n</var>) as the number of triangles present in a triangle of <i>size
  <var>n</var></i>, then</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:50px;\">T(1) = 16<br>\r\nT(2)
  = 104</p>\r\n<p>Find T(36).</p>\r\n\r\n"
