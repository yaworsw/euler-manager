:name: Cross-hatched triangles
:content:
- Consider an equilateral triangle in which straight lines are drawn from each vertex
  to the middle of the opposite side, such as in the <i>size 1</i> triangle in the
  sketch below.
- Sixteen triangles of either different shape or size or orientation or location can
  now be observed in that triangle. Using <i>size 1</i> triangles as building blocks,
  larger triangles can be formed, such as the <i>size 2</i> triangle in the above
  sketch. One-hundred and four triangles of either different shape or size or orientation
  or location can now be observed in that <i>size 2</i> triangle.
- It can be observed that the <i>size 2</i> triangle contains 4 <i>size 1</i> triangle
  building blocks. A <i>size 3</i> triangle would contain 9 <i>size 1</i> triangle
  building blocks and a <i>size n</i> triangle would thus contain <i>n<sup>2</sup>
  size 1</i> triangle building blocks.
- If we denote T(<var>n</var>) as the number of triangles present in a triangle of
  <i>size <var>n</var></i>, then
- "T(1) = 16<br>\r\nT(2) = 104"
- Find T(36).
