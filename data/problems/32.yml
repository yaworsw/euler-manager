:content: "\r\n<p>We shall say that an <var>n</var>-digit number is pandigital if
  it makes use of all the digits 1 to <var>n</var> exactly once; for example, the
  5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The product 7254
  is unusual, as the identity, 39 <img src=\"images/symbol_times.gif\" width=\"9\"
  height=\"9\" alt=\"×\" border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> 186 = 7254,
  containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find
  the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written
  as a 1 through 9 pandigital.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"info\">HINT: Some products
  can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your
  sum.</div>\r\n\r\n"
