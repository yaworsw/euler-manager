:name: Exploring Pascal's triangle
:content:
- 'We can easily verify that none of the entries in the first seven rows of Pascal''s
  triangle are divisible by 7:'
- However, if we check the first one hundred rows, we will find that only 2361 of
  the 5050 entries are <i>not</i> divisible by 7.
- Find the number of entries which are <i>not</i> divisible by 7 in the first one
  billion (10<sup>9</sup>) rows of Pascal's triangle.
