- "An electric circuit uses exclusively identical capacitors of the same value C.\r\n<br>\r\nThe
  capacitors can be connected in series or in parallel to form sub-units, which can
  then be connected in series or in parallel with other capacitors or other sub-units
  to form larger sub-units, and so on up to a final circuit."
- 'Using this simple procedure and up to <var>n</var> identical capacitors, we can
  make circuits having a range of different total capacitances. For example, using
  up to <var>n</var>=3 capacitors of 60 <img src="project/images/p_155_capsmu.gif"
  width="12" height="21" alt="" style="vertical-align:middle;">F each, we can obtain
  the following 7 distinct total capacitance values: '
- 'If we denote by <var>D</var>(<var>n</var>) the number of distinct total capacitance
  values we can obtain when using up to <var>n</var> equal-valued capacitors and the
  simple procedure described above, we have: <var>D</var>(1)=1, <var>D</var>(2)=3,
  <var>D</var>(3)=7 ...'
- Find <var>D</var>(18).
- "<i>Reminder :</i> When connecting capacitors C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub> etc in
  parallel, the total capacitance is C<sub>T</sub> = C<sub>1</sub> + C<sub>2</sub> +...,\r\n<br>\r\nwhereas
  when connecting them in series, the overall capacitance is given by:\r\n<img src=\"project/images/p_155_capsform.gif\"
