:content: "\r\n<p>A series of three rooms are connected to each other by automatic
  doors.</p>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://projecteuler.net/project/images/p_327_rooms_of_doom.gif\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Each
  door is operated by a security card. Once you enter a room the door automatically
  closes and that security card cannot be used again. A machine at the start will
  dispense an unlimited number of cards, but each room (including the starting room)
  contains scanners and if they detect that you are holding more than three security
  cards or if they detect an unattended security card on the floor, then all the doors
  will become permanently locked. However, each room contains a box where you may
  safely store any number of security cards for use at a later stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If
  you simply tried to travel through the rooms one at a time then as you entered room
  3 you would have used all three cards and would be trapped in that room forever!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However,
  if you make use of the storage boxes, then escape is possible. For example, you
  could enter room 1 using your first card, place one card in the storage box, and
  use your third card to exit the room back to the start. Then after collecting three
  more cards from the dispensing machine you could use one to enter room 1 and collect
  the card you placed in the box a moment ago. You now have three cards again and
  will be able to travel through the remaining three doors. This method allows you
  to travel through all three rooms using six security cards in total.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It
  is possible to travel through six rooms using a total of 123 security cards while
  carrying a maximum of 3 cards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let <var>C</var> be the maximum number
  of cards which can be carried at any time.</p>\r\n<p>Let <var>R</var> be the number
  of rooms to travel through.</p>\r\n<p>Let M(<var>C</var>,<var>R</var>) be the minimum
  number of cards required from the dispensing machine to travel through <var>R</var>
  rooms carrying up to a maximum of <var>C</var> cards at any time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For
  example, M(3,6)=123 and M(4,6)=23.<br>And, ΣM(<var>C</var>,6)=146 for 3 <img src=\"images/symbol_le.gif\"

  <img src=\"images/symbol_le.gif\" width=\"10\" height=\"12\" alt=\"≤\" border=\"0\"
  style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> 4.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You are given that ΣM(<var>C</var>,10)=10382
  for 3 <img src=\"images/symbol_le.gif\" width=\"10\" height=\"12\" alt=\"≤\" border=\"0\"
  style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"><var>C</var> <img src=\"images/symbol_le.gif\"
  width=\"10\" height=\"12\" alt=\"≤\" border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">
  10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find ΣM(<var>C</var>,30) for 3 <img src=\"images/symbol_le.gif\"
