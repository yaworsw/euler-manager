:content: "\r\n<p>In  the hexadecimal number system numbers are represented using
  16 different digits:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F</div>\r\n<p>The
  hexadecimal number AF when written in the decimal number system equals 10x16+15=175.</p>\r\n<p>In
  the 3-digit hexadecimal numbers 10A, 1A0, A10, and A01 the digits 0,1 and A are
  all present.<br>\r\nLike numbers written in base ten we write hexadecimal numbers
  without leading zeroes.</p>\r\n<p>How many hexadecimal numbers containing at most
  sixteen hexadecimal digits exist with all of the digits 0,1, and A present at least
  once?<br>\r\nGive your answer as a hexadecimal number.</p>\r\n<p>(A,B,C,D,E and
  F in upper case, without any leading or trailing code that marks the number as hexadecimal
  and without leading zeroes , e.g. 1A3F and not: 1a3f and not 0x1a3f and not $1A3F
  and not #1A3F and not 0000001A3F)</p>\r\n"
