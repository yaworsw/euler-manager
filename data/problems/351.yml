:content: "\r\n<p>A <i>hexagonal orchard</i> of order <var>n</var> is a triangular
  lattice made up of points within a regular hexagon with side <var>n</var>. The following
  is an example of a hexagonal orchard of order 5:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n<img
  src=\"project/images/p_351_hexorchard.png\"><br>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHighlighted
  in green are the points which are hidden from the center by a point closer to it.
  It can be seen that for a hexagonal orchard of order 5, 30 points are hidden from
  the center.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLet H(<var>n</var>) be the number of points hidden
  from the center in a hexagonal orchard of order <var>n</var>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nH(5)
  = 30. H(10) = 138. H(1 000) = 1177848.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFind H(100 000 000).\r\n</p>\r\n"
