- "A <i>hexagonal orchard</i> of order <var>n</var> is a triangular lattice made up
  of points within a regular hexagon with side <var>n</var>. The following is an example
  of a hexagonal orchard of order 5:\r\n"
- "\r\nHighlighted in green are the points which are hidden from the center by a point
  closer to it. It can be seen that for a hexagonal orchard of order 5, 30 points
  are hidden from the center.\r\n"
- "\r\nLet H(<var>n</var>) be the number of points hidden from the center in a hexagonal
  orchard of order <var>n</var>.\r\n"
- "\r\nH(5) = 30. H(10) = 138. H(1 000) = 1177848.\r\n"
- "\r\nFind H(100 000 000).\r\n"
