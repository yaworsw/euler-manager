:name: Investigating Ulam sequences
:content: "\r\n<p>For two positive integers a and b, the Ulam sequence U(a,b) is defined
  by U(a,b)<sub>1</sub> = a, U(a,b)<sub>2</sub> = b and for k &gt; 2,\r\nU(a,b)<sub>k</sub>
  is the smallest integer greater than U(a,b)<sub>(k-1)</sub> which can be written
  in exactly one way as the sum of two distinct previous members of U(a,b).</p>\r\n<p>For
  example, the sequence U(1,2) begins with<br>\r\n1, 2, 3 = 1 + 2, 4 = 1 + 3, 6 =
  2 + 4, 8 = 2 + 6, 11 = 3 + 8;<br>\r\n5 does not belong to it because 5 = 1 + 4 =
  2 + 3 has two representations as the sum of two previous members, likewise 7 = 1
  + 6 = 3 + 4.</p>\r\n<p>Find <img src=\"images/symbol_sum.gif\" width=\"11\" height=\"14\"
