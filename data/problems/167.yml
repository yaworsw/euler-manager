:content: "For two positive integers a and b, the Ulam sequence U(a,b) is defined
  by U(a,b)<sub>1</sub> = a, U(a,b)<sub>2</sub> = b and for k > 2,\rU(a,b)<sub>k</sub>
  is the smallest integer greater than U(a,b)<sub>(k-1)</sub> which can be written
  in exactly one way as the sum of two distinct previous members of U(a,b).\n\nFor
  example, the sequence U(1,2) begins with  \n\r1, 2, 3 = 1 + 2, 4 = 1 + 3, 6 = 2
  + 4, 8 = 2 + 6, 11 = 3 + 8;  \n\r5 does not belong to it because 5 = 1 + 4 = 2 +
  3 has two representations as the sum of two previous members, likewise 7 = 1 + 6
  = 3 + 4.\n\nFind ![∑](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_sum.gif)U(2,2<var>n</var>+1)<sub><var>k</var></sub>
  for 2 ![≤](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_le.gif) <var>n</var>
  ![≤](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_le.gif)10, where
