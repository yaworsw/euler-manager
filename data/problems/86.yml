:content: "\r\n<p>A spider, S, sits in one corner of a cuboid room, measuring 6 by
  5 by 3, and a fly, F, sits in the opposite corner. By travelling on the surfaces
  of the room the shortest \"straight line\" distance from S to F is 10 and the path
  is shown on the diagram.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\r\n<img src=\"project/images/p_086.gif\"

  for any given cuboid and the shortest route doesn't always have integer length.</p>\r\n<p>By
  considering all cuboid rooms with integer dimensions, up to a maximum size of M
  by M by M, there are exactly 2060 cuboids for which the shortest route has integer
  length when M=100, and this is the least value of M for which the number of solutions
  first exceeds two thousand; the number of solutions is 1975 when M=99.</p>\r\n<p>Find
  the least value of M such that the number of solutions first exceeds one million.</p>\r\n\r\n"
