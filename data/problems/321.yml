:content: "\r\n<p>A horizontal row comprising of 2<var>n</var> + 1 squares has <var>n</var>
  red counters placed at one end and <var>n</var> blue counters at the other end,
  being separated by a single empty square in the centre. For example, when <var>n</var>
  = 3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"project/images/p_321_swapping_counters_1.gif\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>A
  counter can move from one square to the next (slide) or can jump over another counter
  (hop) as long as the square next to that counter is unoccupied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\n<div
  align=\"center\"><img src=\"project/images/p_321_swapping_counters_2.gif\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Let
  M(<var>n</var>) represent the minimum number of moves/actions to completely reverse
  the positions of the coloured counters; that is, move all the red counters to the
  right and all the blue counters to the left.</p>\r\n<p>It can be verified M(3) =
  15, which also happens to be a triangle number.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we create a sequence
  based on the values of <var>n</var> for which M(<var>n</var>) is a triangle number
  then the first five terms would be:\r\n<br>1, 3, 10, 22, and 63, and their sum would
  be 99.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find the sum of the first forty terms of this sequence.</p>\r\n"
