:content: "\rDefine f(0)=1 and f(<var>n</var>) to be the number of ways to write <var>n</var>
  as a sum of powers of 2 where no power occurs more than twice.   \n  \n  \n\r\rFor
  example, f(10)=5 since there are five different ways to express 10:  \n10 = 8+2
  = 8+1+1 = 4+4+2 = 4+2+2+1+1 = 4+4+1+1  \n  \n  \n\r\rIt can be shown that for every
  fraction <var>p/q</var> (<var>p</var> ![>](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_gt.gif)0,
  <var>q</var> ![>](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_gt.gif)0)
  there exists at least one integer <var>n</var> such that  \n f(<var>n</var>)/f(<var>n</var>-1)=<var>p/q</var>.
  \ \n  \n  \n\rFor instance, the smallest <var>n</var> for which f(<var>n</var>)/f(<var>n</var>-1)=13/17
  is 241.  \n\rThe binary expansion of 241 is 11110001.  \n\rReading this binary number
  from the most significant bit to the least significant bit there are 4 one's, 3
  zeroes and 1 one. We shall call the string 4,3,1 the Shortened Binary Expansion
  of 241.  \n  \n  \n\rFind the Shortened Binary Expansion of the smallest <var>n</var>
  for which  \n f(<var>n</var>)/f(<var>n</var>-1)=123456789/987654321.  \n  \n  \n\rGive
  your answer as comma separated integers, without any whitespaces.\r\n"
