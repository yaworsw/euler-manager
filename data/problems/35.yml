:content: "\r\n\n<p>The number, 197, is called a circular prime because all rotations
  of the digits: 197, 971, and 719, are themselves prime.</p>\n<p>There are thirteen
  such primes below 100: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97.</p>\n<p>How
  many circular primes are there below one million?</p>\n\r\n"
