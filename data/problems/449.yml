:content: "\r\n<p>Phil the confectioner is making a new batch of chocolate covered
  candy. Each candy centre is shaped like an ellipsoid of revolution defined by the
  equation: b<sup>2</sup><var>x</var><sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup><var>y</var><sup>2</sup>
  + a<sup>2</sup><var>z</var><sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup>b<sup>2</sup>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPhil
  wants to know how much chocolate is needed to cover one candy centre with a uniform
  coat of chocolate one millimeter thick.\r\n</p>\n<table class=\"formula\"><tr>\n<td>If
  a=1 mm and b=1 mm, the amount of chocolate required is \r\n    </td>\r\n    <td><table
  class=\"frac\">\n<tr><td>28</td></tr>\n<tr><td class=\"overline\">3</td></tr>\n</table></td>\r\n
  \   <td>π mm<sup>3</sup>\n</td>\r\n</tr></table>\r\nIf a=2 mm and b=1 mm, the amount
  of chocolate required is approximately 60.35475635 mm<sup>3</sup>.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFind
  the amount of chocolate in mm<sup>3</sup> required if a=3 mm and b=1 mm. Give your
  answer as the number rounded to 8 decimal places behind the decimal point.</p>\r\n
