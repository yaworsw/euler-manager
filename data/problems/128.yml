:name: Hexagonal tile differences
:content: "\r\n\n<p>A hexagonal tile with number 1 is surrounded by a ring of six
  hexagonal tiles, starting at \"12 o'clock\" and numbering the tiles 2 to 7 in an
  anti-clockwise direction.</p>\n<p>New rings are added in the same fashion, with
  the next rings being numbered 8 to 19, 20 to 37, 38 to 61, and so on. The diagram
  below shows the first three rings.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img
  src=\"project/images/p_128.gif\" width=\"400\" height=\"431\" alt=\"\">\n</div>\n<p>By
  finding the difference between tile <i>n</i> and each its six neighbours we shall
  define PD(<i>n</i>) to be the number of those differences which are prime.</p>\n<p>For
  example, working clockwise around tile 8 the differences are 12, 29, 11, 6, 1, and
  13. So PD(8) = 3.</p>\n<p>In the same way, the differences around tile 17 are 1,
  17, 16, 1, 11, and 10, hence PD(17) = 2.</p>\n<p>It can be shown that the maximum
  value of PD(<i>n</i>) is 3.</p>\n<p>If all of the tiles for which PD(<i>n</i>) =
  3 are listed in ascending order to form a sequence, the 10th tile would be 271.</p>\n<p>Find
  the 2000th tile in this sequence.</p>\n\r\n"
