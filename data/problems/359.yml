:content: "\r\n<p>\r\nAn infinite number of people (numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.) are lined
  up to get a room at Hilbert's newest infinite hotel. The hotel contains an infinite
  number of floors (numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.), and each floor contains an infinite number
  of rooms (numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.). \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nInitially the hotel is
  empty. Hilbert declares a rule on how the <var>n</var><sup>th</sup> person is assigned
  a room: person <var>n</var> gets the first vacant room in the lowest numbered floor
  satisfying either of the following:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the floor is empty</li>\r\n<li>the
  floor is not empty, and if the latest person taking a room in that floor is person
  <var>m</var>, then <var>m</var> + <var>n</var> is a perfect square</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>\r\nPerson
  1 gets room 1 in floor 1 since floor 1 is empty.\r\n<br>Person 2 does not get room
  2 in floor 1 since 1 + 2 = 3 is not a perfect square.\r\n<br>Person 2 instead gets
  room 1 in floor 2 since floor 2 is empty.\r\n<br>Person 3 gets room 2 in floor 1
  since 1 + 3 = 4 is a perfect square.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nEventually, every person
  in the line gets a room in the hotel.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDefine P(<var>f</var>,
  <var>r</var>) to be <var>n</var> if person <var>n</var> occupies room <var>r</var>
  in floor <var>f</var>, and 0 if no person occupies the room. Here are a few examples:\r\n<br>P(1,
  1) = 1\r\n<br>P(1, 2) = 3\r\n<br>P(2, 1) = 2\r\n<br>P(10, 20) = 440\r\n<br>P(25,
  75) = 4863\r\n<br>P(99, 100) = 19454\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFind the sum of all P(<var>f</var>,
  <var>r</var>) for all positive <var>f</var> and <var>r</var> such that <var>f</var>
  <img src=\"images/symbol_times.gif\" width=\"9\" height=\"9\" alt=\"×\" border=\"0\"

  8 digits as your answer.\r\n</p>\r\n"
