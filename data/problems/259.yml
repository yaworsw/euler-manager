:content: "\r\n<p>A positive integer will be called <i>reachable</i> if it can result
  from an arithmetic expression obeying the following rules:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Uses
  the digits 1 through 9, in that order and exactly once each.</li>\r\n<li>Any successive
  digits can be concatenated (for example, using the digits 2, 3 and 4 we obtain the
  number 234).</li>\r\n<li>Only the four usual binary arithmetic operations (addition,
  subtraction, multiplication and division) are allowed.</li>\r\n<li>Each operation
  can be used any number of times, or not at all.</li>\r\n<li>\n<dfn title=\"A minus
  sign applied to a single operand (as opposed to a subtraction operator between two
  operands)\">Unary minus</dfn> is not allowed.</li>\r\n<li>Any number of (possibly
  nested) parentheses may be used to define the order of operations.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>For
  example, 42 is reachable, since (1/23) * ((4*5)-6) * (78-9) = 42.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What
  is the sum of all positive reachable integers?</p>\r\n"
