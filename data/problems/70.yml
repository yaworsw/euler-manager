:content: "Euler's Totient function, φ(<var>n</var>) [sometimes called the phi function],
  is used to determine the number of positive numbers less than or equal to <var>n</var>
  which are relatively prime to <var>n</var>. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8,
  are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, φ(9)=6.  \nThe number 1 is
  considered to be relatively prime to every positive number, so φ(1)=1.\n\nInterestingly,
  φ(87109)=79180, and it can be seen that 87109 is a permutation of 79180.\n\nFind
  the value of <var>n</var>, 1 ![<](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_lt.gif)
  <var>n</var> ![<](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_lt.gif)
  10<sup>7</sup>, for which φ(<var>n</var>) is a permutation of <var>n</var> and the
  ratio <var>n</var>/φ(<var>n</var>) produces a minimum.\n\n"
