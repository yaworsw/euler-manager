:content:
- 'Euler''s Totient function, φ(<var>n</var>) [sometimes called the phi function],
  is used to determine the number of positive numbers less than or equal to <var>n</var>
  which are relatively prime to <var>n</var>. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8,
  are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, φ(9)=6.<br>The number 1 is
  considered to be relatively prime to every positive number, so φ(1)=1. '
- Interestingly, φ(87109)=79180, and it can be seen that 87109 is a permutation of
  79180.
- Find the value of <var>n</var>, 1 <img src="images/symbol_lt.gif" width="10" height="10"
  alt="&lt;" border="0" style="vertical-align:middle;"><var>n</var> <img src="images/symbol_lt.gif"
  width="10" height="10" alt="&lt;" border="0" style="vertical-align:middle;"> 10<sup>7</sup>,
  for which φ(<var>n</var>) is a permutation of <var>n</var> and the ratio <var>n</var>/φ(<var>n</var>)
  produces a minimum.
