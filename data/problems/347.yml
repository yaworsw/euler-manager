:content: "The largest integer ![≤](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_le.gif)
  100 that is only divisible by both the primes 2 and 3 is 96, as 96=32\\*3=2<sup>5</sup>\\*3.\rFor
  two _distinct_ primes p and q let M(p,q,N) be the largest positive integer ![≤](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_le.gif)N
  only divisible\rby both p and q and M(p,q,N)=0 if such a positive integer does not
  exist.\n\nE.g. M(2,3,100)=96.  \n \rM(3,5,100)=75 and not 90 because 90 is divisible
  by 2 ,3 and 5.  \n\rAlso M(2,73,100)=0 because there does not exist a positive integer
  ![≤](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_le.gif) 100 that
  is divisible by both 2 and 73.\n\nLet S(N) be the sum of all distinct M(p,q,N).\rS(100)=2262.\n\nFind
  S(10 000 000).\n\n"
