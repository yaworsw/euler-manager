:name: 'Special subset sums: optimum'
:content:
- 'Let S(A) represent the sum of elements in set A of size <i>n</i>. We shall call
  it a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets, B and C, the following
  properties are true:'
- If S(A) is minimised for a given <i>n</i>, we shall call it an optimum special sum
  set. The first five optimum special sum sets are given below.
- "<i>n</i> = 1: {1}<br><i>n</i> = 2: {1, 2}<br><i>n</i> = 3: {2, 3, 4}<br><i>n</i>
  = 4: {3, 5, 6, 7}<br><i>n</i> = 5: {6, 9, 11, 12, 13}"
- It <i>seems</i> that for a given optimum set, A = {<i>a</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>a</i><sub>2</sub>,
  ... , <i>a</i><sub>n</sub>}, the next optimum set is of the form B = {<i>b</i>,
  <i>a</i><sub>1</sub>+<i>b</i>, <i>a</i><sub>2</sub>+<i>b</i>, ... ,<i>a</i><sub>n</sub>+<i>b</i>},
  where <i>b</i> is the "middle" element on the previous row.
- 'By applying this "rule" we would expect the optimum set for <i>n</i> = 6 to be
  A = {11, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24}, with S(A) = 117. However, this is not the optimum
  set, as we have merely applied an algorithm to provide a near optimum set. The optimum
  set for <i>n</i> = 6 is A = {11, 18, 19, 20, 22, 25}, with S(A) = 115 and corresponding
  set string: 111819202225.'
- Given that A is an optimum special sum set for <i>n</i> = 7, find its set string.
