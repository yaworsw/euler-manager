:content: "The minimum number of cubes to cover every visible face on a cuboid measuring
  3 x 2 x 1 is twenty-two.\n\n ![]({{ images_dir }}/p_126.gif)  \n\nIf we then add
  a second layer to this solid it would require forty-six cubes to cover every visible
  face, the third layer would require seventy-eight cubes, and the fourth layer would
  require one-hundred and eighteen cubes to cover every visible face.\n\nHowever,
  the first layer on a cuboid measuring 5 x 1 x 1 also requires twenty-two cubes;
  similarly the first layer on cuboids measuring 5 x 3 x 1, 7 x 2 x 1, and 11 x 1 x 1
  all contain forty-six cubes.\n\nWe shall define C(_n_) to represent the number of
  cuboids that contain _n_ cubes in one of its layers. So C(22) = 2, C(46) = 4, C(78)
  = 5, and C(118) = 8.\n\nIt turns out that 154 is the least value of _n_ for which
  C(_n_) = 10.\n\nFind the least value of _n_ for which C(_n_) = 1000.\n\n"
