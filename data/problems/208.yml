:content: "A robot moves in a series of one-fifth circular arcs (72°), with a free
  choice of a clockwise or an anticlockwise arc for each step, but no turning on the
  spot.\n\nOne of 70932 possible closed paths of 25 arcs starting northward is\n\n
  ![](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/p_208_robotwalk.gif)\n\nGiven
  that the robot starts facing North, how many journeys of 70 arcs in length can it
  take that return it, after the final arc, to its starting position?  \n<!--(Journeys
  are allowed to return multiple times to the start.)-->\r(Any arc may be traversed
  multiple times.)\n\n"
