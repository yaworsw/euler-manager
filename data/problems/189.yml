:name: Tri-colouring a triangular grid
:url: http://projecteuler.net/problem=189
:content: "Consider the following configuration of 64 triangles:\n\n ![](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/p_189_grid.gif)\n\nWe
  wish to colour the interior of each triangle with one of three colours: red, green
  or blue, so that no two neighbouring triangles have the same colour. Such a colouring
  shall be called valid. Here, two triangles are said to be neighbouring if they share
  an edge.  \n\rNote: if they only share a vertex, then they are not neighbours.\n\nFor
  example, here is a valid colouring of the above grid:\n\n ![](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/p_189_colours.gif)\n\nA
  colouring C' which is obtained from a colouring C by rotation or reflection is considered
  _distinct_ from C unless the two are identical.\n\nHow many distinct valid colourings
  are there for the above configuration?\n\n"
