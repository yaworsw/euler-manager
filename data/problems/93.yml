:content: "By using each of the digits from the set, {1, 2, 3, 4}, exactly once, and
  making use of the four arithmetic operations (+, ![−](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_minus.gif),
  \\*, /) and brackets/parentheses, it is possible to form different positive integer
  targets.\n\nFor example,\n\n8 = (4 \\* (1 + 3)) / 2  \n14 = 4 \\* (3 + 1 / 2)  \n19
  = 4 \\* (2 + 3) ![−](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_minus.gif)
  1  \n36 = 3 \\* 4 \\* (2 + 1)\n\nNote that concatenations of the digits, like 12
  + 34, are not allowed.\n\nUsing the set, {1, 2, 3, 4}, it is possible to obtain
  thirty-one different target numbers of which 36 is the maximum, and each of the
  numbers 1 to 28 can be obtained before encountering the first non-expressible number.\n\nFind
  the set of four distinct digits, _a_ ![<](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_lt.gif)
  _b_ &lt _c_ ![<](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_lt.gif)
  _d_, for which the longest set of consecutive positive integers, 1 to _n_, can be
  obtained, giving your answer as a string: _abcd_.\n\n"
