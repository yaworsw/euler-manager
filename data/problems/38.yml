- 'Take the number 192 and multiply it by each of 1, 2, and 3:'
- By concatenating each product we get the 1 to 9 pandigital, 192384576. We will call
  192384576 the concatenated product of 192 and (1,2,3)
- The same can be achieved by starting with 9 and multiplying by 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5,
  giving the pandigital, 918273645, which is the concatenated product of 9 and (1,2,3,4,5).
- What is the largest 1 to 9 pandigital 9-digit number that can be formed as the concatenated
  product of an integer with (1,2, ... , <var>n</var>) where <var>n</var> <img src="images/symbol_gt.gif"
