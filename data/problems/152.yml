:content: "\r\n<p>There are several ways to write the number 1/2 as a sum of inverse
  squares using <i>distinct</i> integers.</p>\r\n<p>For instance, the numbers {2,3,4,5,7,12,15,20,28,35}
  can be used:</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:50px;\"><img src=\"http://projecteuler.net/project/images/p_152_sum.gif\"
  border=\"0\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<p>In fact, only using integers between 2 and 45 inclusive,
  there are exactly three ways to do it, the remaining two being: {2,3,4,6,7,9,10,20,28,35,36,45}
  and {2,3,4,6,7,9,12,15,28,30,35,36,45}.</p>\r\n<p>How many ways are there to write
  the number 1/2 as a sum of inverse squares using distinct integers between 2 and
  80 inclusive?</p>\r\n"
