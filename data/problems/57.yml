- It is possible to show that the square root of two can be expressed as an infinite
  continued fraction.
- "<img src=\"images/symbol_radic.gif\" width=\"14\" height=\"16\" alt=\"√\" border=\"0\"
  style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> 2 = 1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + ... ))) = 1.414213..."
- 'By expanding this for the first four iterations, we get:'
- "1 + 1/2 = 3/2 = 1.5<br>\r\n1 + 1/(2 + 1/2) = 7/5 = 1.4<br>\r\n1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 +
  1/2)) = 17/12 = 1.41666...<br>\r\n1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2))) = 41/29 = 1.41379...<br>"
- The next three expansions are 99/70, 239/169, and 577/408, but the eighth expansion,
  1393/985, is the first example where the number of digits in the numerator exceeds
  the number of digits in the denominator.
- In the first one-thousand expansions, how many fractions contain a numerator with
  more digits than denominator?
