:name: Sum of a square and a cube
:content:
- Many numbers can be expressed as the sum of a square and a cube. Some of them in
  more than one way.
- "Consider the palindromic numbers that can be expressed as the sum of a square and
  a cube, both greater than 1, in <b>exactly</b> 4 different ways.<br>\r\nFor example,
  5229225 is a palindromic number and it can be expressed in exactly 4 different ways:"
- "2285<sup>2</sup> + 20<sup>3</sup><br>\r\n2223<sup>2</sup> + 66<sup>3</sup><br>\r\n1810<sup>2</sup>
  + 125<sup>3</sup><br>\r\n1197<sup>2</sup> + 156<sup>3</sup>"
- Find the sum of the five smallest such palindromic numbers.
