:content: "\r\n\n<p>The number 3797 has an interesting property. Being prime itself,
  it is possible to continuously remove digits from left to right, and remain prime
  at each stage: 3797, 797, 97, and 7. Similarly we can work from right to left: 3797,
  379, 37, and 3.</p>\n<p>Find the sum of the only eleven primes that are both truncatable
  from left to right and right to left.</p>\n<p class=\"info\">NOTE: 2, 3, 5, and
  7 are not considered to be truncatable primes.</p>\n\r\n"
