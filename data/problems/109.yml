:content: "\r\n<p>In the game of darts a player throws three darts at a target board
  which is split into twenty equal sized sections numbered one to twenty.</p>\r\n<div
  style=\"text-align:center;\">\r\n<img src=\"project/images/p_109.gif\" width=\"400\"
  height=\"400\" alt=\"\"><br>\n</div>\r\n<p>The score of a dart is determined by
  the number of the region that the dart lands in. A dart landing outside the red/green
  outer ring scores zero. The black and cream regions inside this ring represent single
  scores. However, the red/green outer ring and middle ring score double and treble
  scores respectively.</p>\r\n<p>At the centre of the board are two concentric circles
  called the bull region, or bulls-eye. The outer bull is worth 25 points and the
  inner bull is a double, worth 50 points.</p>\r\n<p>There are many variations of
  rules but in the most popular game the players will begin with a score 301 or 501
  and the first player to reduce their running total to zero is a winner. However,
  it is normal to play a \"doubles out\" system, which means that the player must
  land a double (including the double bulls-eye at the centre of the board) on their
  final dart to win; any other dart that would reduce their running total to one or
  lower means the score for that set of three darts is \"bust\".</p>\r\n<p>When a
  player is able to finish  on their current score it is called a \"checkout\" and
  the highest checkout is 170: T20 T20 D25 (two treble 20s and double bull).</p>\r\n<p>There
  are exactly eleven distinct ways to checkout on a score of 6:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\r\n<table
  border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"center\">\n<tr>\n<td>\n<img
  src=\"images/spacer.gif\" width=\"80\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><br>D3</td>\r\n<td>\n<img
  src=\"images/spacer.gif\" width=\"80\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><br> </td>\r\n<td>\n<img
  src=\"images/spacer.gif\" width=\"80\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><br> </td>\r\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>D1</td>\r\n<td>D2</td>\r\n<td> </td>\r\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>S2</td>\r\n<td>D2</td>\r\n<td> </td>\r\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>D2</td>\r\n<td>D1</td>\r\n<td> </td>\r\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>S4</td>\r\n<td>D1</td>\r\n<td> </td>\r\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>S1</td>\r\n<td>S1</td>\r\n<td>D2</td>\r\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>S1</td>\r\n<td>T1</td>\r\n<td>D1</td>\r\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>S1</td>\r\n<td>S3</td>\r\n<td>D1</td>\r\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>D1</td>\r\n<td>D1</td>\r\n<td>D1</td>\r\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>D1</td>\r\n<td>S2</td>\r\n<td>D1</td>\r\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>S2</td>\r\n<td>S2</td>\r\n<td>D1</td>\r\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>\r\n<p>Note
  that D1 D2 is considered <b>different</b> to D2 D1 as they finish on different doubles.
  However, the combination S1 T1 D1 is considered the <b>same</b> as T1 S1 D1.</p>\r\n<p>In
  addition we shall not include misses in considering combinations; for example, D3
  is the <b>same</b> as 0 D3 and 0 0 D3.</p>\r\n<p>Incredibly there are 42336 distinct
  ways of checking out in total.</p>\r\n<p>How many distinct ways can a player checkout
  with a score less than 100?</p>\r\n\r\n"
