:name: Find the 200th prime-proof sqube containing the contiguous sub-string "200"
:url: http://projecteuler.net/problem=200
:content: "We shall define a sqube to be a number of the form, <var>p</var><sup>2</sup><var>q</var><sup>3</sup>,
  where <var>p</var> and <var>q</var> are distinct primes.  \n\rFor example, 200 =
  5<sup>2</sup>2<sup>3</sup> or 120072949 = 23<sup>2</sup>61<sup>3</sup>.\n\nThe first
  five squbes are 72, 108, 200, 392, and 500.\n\nInterestingly, 200 is also the first
  number for which you cannot change any single digit to make a prime; we shall call
  such numbers, prime-proof. The next prime-proof sqube which contains the contiguous
  sub-string \"200\" is 1992008.\n\nFind the 200th prime-proof sqube containing the
  contiguous sub-string \"200\".\n\n"
