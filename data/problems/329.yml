:content: "\r\n<p>Susan has a prime frog.<br>\r\nHer frog is jumping around over 500
  squares numbered 1 to 500.\r\nHe can only jump one square to the left or to the
  right, with equal probability, and he cannot jump outside the range [1;500].<br>(if
  it lands at either end, it automatically jumps to the only available square on the
  next move.)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen he is on a square with a prime number on it,
  he croaks 'P' (PRIME) with probability 2/3 or 'N' (NOT PRIME) with probability 1/3
  just before jumping to the next square.<br>\r\nWhen he is on a square with a number
  on it that is not a prime he croaks 'P' with probability 1/3 or 'N' with probability
  2/3 just before jumping to the next square.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nGiven that the frog's
  starting position is random with the same probability for every square, and given
  that she listens to his first 15 croaks, what is the probability that she hears
  the sequence PPPPNNPPPNPPNPN?\r\n</p>\r\nGive your answer as a fraction p/q in reduced
  form.\r\n\r\n"
