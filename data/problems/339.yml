  and the borders of the valley were wooded, and on each side of the river were level
  meadows. And on one side of the river he saw a flock of white sheep, and on the
  other a flock of black sheep. And whenever one of the white sheep bleated, one of
  the black sheep would cross over and become white; and when one of the black sheep
  bleated, one of the white sheep would cross over and become black.\"</i><br><a href=\"http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Mabinogion/Peredur_the_Son_of_Evrawc\">en.wikisource.org</a>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nInitially
  each flock consists of <var>n</var> sheep. Each sheep (regardless of colour) is
  equally likely to be the next sheep to bleat. After a sheep has bleated and a sheep
  from the other flock has crossed over, Peredur may remove a number of white sheep
  in order to maximize the expected final number of black sheep. Let E(<var>n</var>)
  be the expected final number of black sheep if Peredur uses an optimal strategy.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nYou
  are given that E(5) = 6.871346 rounded to 6 places behind the decimal point.<br>\r\nFind
  E(10 000) and give your answer rounded to 6 places behind the decimal point.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"
