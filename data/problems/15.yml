  Starting in the top left corner of a 2 ![×]({{ images_dir }}/symbol_times.gif)2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.

   ![]({{ images_dir }}/p_015.gif)

  How many such routes are there through a 20 ![×]({{ images_dir }}/symbol_times.gif)20 grid?
