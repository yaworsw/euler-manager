:name: Exploring the number of different ways a number can be expressed as a sum of
  powers of 2
:content: "\r\n<p>Define f(0)=1 and f(<var>n</var>) to be the number of different
  ways <var>n</var> can be expressed as a sum of integer powers of 2 using each power
  no more than twice.</p>\r\n<p>For example, f(10)=5 since there are five different
  ways to express 10:</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:50px;\">1 + 1 + 8<br>\r\n1 + 1
