:content: "\r\n<p>Two players share an unbiased coin and take it in turns to play
  \"The Race\". On Player 1's turn, he tosses the coin once: if it comes up Heads,
  he scores one point; if it comes up Tails, he scores nothing. On Player 2's turn,
  she chooses a positive integer <var>T</var> and tosses the coin <var>T</var> times:
  if it comes up all Heads, she scores 2<sup><var>T</var>-1</sup> points; otherwise,
  she scores nothing. Player 1 goes first. The winner is the first to 100 or more
  points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On each turn Player 2 selects the number, <var>T</var>, of
  coin tosses that maximises the probability of her winning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is
  the probability that Player 2 wins?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Give your answer rounded to eight
  decimal places in the form 0.<i>abcdefgh</i> .</p>\r\n"
