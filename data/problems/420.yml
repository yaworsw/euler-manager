:content: "A _positive integer matrix_ is a matrix whose elements are all positive
  integers.  \n\rSome positive integer matrices can be expressed as a square of a
  positive integer matrix in two different ways. Here is an example:\n\n ![](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/p_420_matrix.gif)\n\nWe
  define F(<var>N</var>) as the number of the 2x2 positive integer matrices which
  have a <dfn title=\"the sum of the elements on the main diagonal\">trace</dfn> less
  than <var>N</var> and which can be expressed as a square of a positive integer matrix
  in two different ways.  \n\rWe can verify that F(50) = 7 and F(1000) = 1019.\n\nFind
  F(10<sup>7</sup>).\n\n"
