  Let S(A) represent the sum of elements in set A of size _n_. We shall call it a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets, B and C, the following properties are true:

  1. S(B) ![≠]({{ images_dir }}/symbol_ne.gif) S(C); that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.
  2. If B contains more elements than C then S(B) ![>]({{ images_dir }}/symbol_gt.gif) S(C).

  For this problem we shall assume that a given set contains _n_ strictly increasing elements and it already satisfies the second rule.

  Surprisingly, out of the 25 possible subset pairs that can be obtained from a set for which _n_ = 4, only 1 of these pairs need to be tested for equality (first rule). Similarly, when _n_ = 7, only 70 out of the 966 subset pairs need to be tested.

  For _n_ = 12, how many of the 261625 subset pairs that can be obtained need to be tested for equality?

  NOTE: This problem is related to [Problem 103](problem=103) and [Problem 105](problem=105).
