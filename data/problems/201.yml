- "For any set A of numbers, let sum(A) be the sum of the elements of A.<br>\r\nConsider
  the set B = {1,3,6,8,10,11}.<br> There are 20 subsets of B containing three elements,
  and their sums are:"

- "Some of these sums occur more than once, others are unique.<br>\r\nFor a set A,
  let U(A,k) be the set of unique sums of k-element subsets of A, in our example we
  find U(B,3) = {10,12,14,18,21,25,27,29} and sum(U(B,3)) = 156."
- "Now consider the 100-element set S = {1<sup>2</sup>, 2<sup>2</sup>, ... , 100<sup>2</sup>}.<br>\r\nS
  has 100891344545564193334812497256 50-element subsets."
- Determine the sum of all integers which are the sum of exactly one of the 50-element
  subsets of S, i.e. find sum(U(S,50)).
