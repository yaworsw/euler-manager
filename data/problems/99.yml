:content: "\r\n\n<p>Comparing two numbers written in index form like 2<sup>11</sup>
  and 3<sup>7</sup> is not difficult, as any calculator would confirm that 2<sup>11</sup>
  = 2048 <img src=\"images/symbol_lt.gif\" width=\"10\" height=\"10\" alt=\"&lt;\"
  border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> 3<sup>7</sup> = 2187.</p>\n<p>However,
  confirming that 632382<sup>518061</sup><img src=\"images/symbol_gt.gif\" width=\"10\"
  height=\"10\" alt=\"&gt;\" border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> 519432<sup>525806</sup>
  would be much more difficult, as both numbers contain over three million digits.</p>\n<p>Using
  <a href=\"project/base_exp.txt\">base_exp.txt</a> (right click and 'Save Link/Target
  As...'), a 22K text file containing one thousand lines with a base/exponent pair
  on each line, determine which line number has the greatest numerical value.</p>\n<p
  class=\"info\">NOTE: The first two lines in the file represent the numbers in the
  example given above.</p>\n\r\n"
