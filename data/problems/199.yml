:name: Iterative Circle Packing
:content:
- Three circles of equal radius are placed inside a larger circle such that each pair
  of circles is tangent to one another and the inner circles do not overlap. There
  are four uncovered "gaps" which are to be filled iteratively with more tangent circles.
- "\r\nAt each iteration, a maximally sized circle is placed in each gap, which creates
  more gaps for the next iteration. After 3 iterations (pictured), there are 108 gaps
  and the fraction of the area which is not covered by circles is 0.06790342, rounded
  to eight decimal places.\r\n"
- "\r\nWhat fraction of the area is not covered by circles after 10 iterations?<br>\r\nGive
  your answer rounded to eight decimal places using the format x.xxxxxxxx .\r\n"
