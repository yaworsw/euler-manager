  If _p_ is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {_a_,_b_,_c_}, there are exactly three solutions for _p_ = 120.

  {20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

  For which value of _p_ ![≤](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_le.gif) 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?
