:name: Exploring Pascal's pyramid
:content:
- A triangular pyramid is constructed using spherical balls so that each ball rests
  on exactly three balls of the next lower level.
- 'Then, we calculate the number of paths leading from the apex to each position:'
- A path starts at the apex and progresses downwards to any of the three spheres directly
  below the current position.
- Consequently, the number of paths to reach a certain position is the sum of the
  numbers immediately above it (depending on the position, there are up to three numbers
  above it).
- "The result is <i>Pascal's pyramid</i> and the numbers at each level <var>n</var>
  are the coefficients of the trinomial expansion \r\n(<var>x + y + z</var>)<sup><var>n</var></sup>."
- How many coefficients in the expansion of (<var>x + y + z</var>)<sup>200000</sup>
  are multiples of 10<sup>12</sup>?
