:content: "\r\n<p>A triangular pyramid is constructed using spherical balls so that
  each ball rests on exactly three balls of the next lower level.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img
  src=\"project/images/p_154_pyramid.gif\" width=\"488\" height=\"379\" alt=\"\"></div>\r\n<p>Then,
  we calculate the number of paths leading from the apex to each position:</p>\r\n<p>A
  path starts at the apex and progresses downwards to any of the three spheres directly
  below the current position.</p>\r\n<p>Consequently, the number of paths to reach
  a certain position is the sum of the numbers immediately above it (depending on
  the position, there are up to three numbers above it).</p>\r\n<p>The result is <i>Pascal's
  pyramid</i> and the numbers at each level <var>n</var> are the coefficients of the
  trinomial expansion \r\n(<var>x + y + z</var>)<sup><var>n</var></sup>.</p>\r\n<p>How
  many coefficients in the expansion of (<var>x + y + z</var>)<sup>200000</sup> are
  multiples of 10<sup>12</sup>?</p>\r\n"
