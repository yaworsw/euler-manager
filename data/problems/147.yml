:name: Rectangles in cross-hatched grids
:content:
- In a 3x2 cross-hatched grid, a total of 37 different rectangles could be situated
  within that grid as indicated in the sketch.
- 'There are 5 grids smaller than 3x2, vertical and horizontal dimensions being important,
  i.e. 1x1, 2x1, 3x1, 1x2 and 2x2. If each of them is cross-hatched, the following
  number of different rectangles could be situated within those smaller grids:'
- "1x1: 1\r\n<br>2x1: 4\r\n<br>3x1: 8\r\n<br>1x2: 4\r\n<br>2x2: 18"
- Adding those to the 37 of the 3x2 grid, a total of 72 different rectangles could
  be situated within 3x2 and smaller grids.
- How many different rectangles could be situated within 47x43 and smaller grids?
