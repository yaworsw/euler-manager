:content: "\r\n<p>In the card game poker, a hand consists of five cards and are ranked,
  from lowest to highest, in the following way:</p>\r\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>High Card</b>:
  Highest value card.</li>\r\n<li>\n<b>One Pair</b>: Two cards of the same value.</li>\r\n<li>\n<b>Two
  Pairs</b>: Two different pairs.</li>\r\n<li>\n<b>Three of a Kind</b>: Three cards
  of the same value.</li>\r\n<li>\n<b>Straight</b>: All cards are consecutive values.</li>\r\n<li>\n<b>Flush</b>:
  All cards of the same suit.</li>\r\n<li>\n<b>Full House</b>: Three of a kind and
  a pair.</li>\r\n<li>\n<b>Four of a Kind</b>: Four cards of the same value.</li>\r\n<li>\n<b>Straight
  Flush</b>: All cards are consecutive values of same suit.</li>\r\n<li>\n<b>Royal
  Flush</b>: Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, in same suit.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>The cards
  are valued in the order:<br>2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace.</p>\r\n<p>If
  two players have the same ranked hands then the rank made up of the highest value
  wins; for example, a pair of eights beats a pair of fives (see example 1 below).
  But if two ranks tie, for example, both players have a pair of queens, then highest
  cards in each hand are compared (see example 4 below); if the highest cards tie
  then the next highest cards are compared, and so on.</p>\r\n<p>Consider the following
  five hands dealt to two players:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\r\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Hand</b></td>\n<td> </td>\n<td><b>Player

  file, <a href=\"project/poker.txt\">poker.txt</a>, contains one-thousand random
  hands dealt to two players. Each line of the file contains ten cards (separated
  by a single space): the first five are Player 1's cards and the last five are Player
  2's cards. You can assume that all hands are valid (no invalid characters or repeated
  cards), each player's hand is in no specific order, and in each hand there is a
  clear winner.</p>\r\n<p>How many hands does Player 1 win?</p>\r\n"
