- 'In the card game poker, a hand consists of five cards and are ranked, from lowest
  to highest, in the following way:'
- The cards are valued in the order:<br>2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King,
  Ace.
- If two players have the same ranked hands then the rank made up of the highest value
  wins; for example, a pair of eights beats a pair of fives (see example 1 below).
  But if two ranks tie, for example, both players have a pair of queens, then highest
  cards in each hand are compared (see example 4 below); if the highest cards tie
  then the next highest cards are compared, and so on.
- 'Consider the following five hands dealt to two players:'
- 'The file, <a href="project/poker.txt">poker.txt</a>, contains one-thousand random
  hands dealt to two players. Each line of the file contains ten cards (separated
  by a single space): the first five are Player 1''s cards and the last five are Player
  2''s cards. You can assume that all hands are valid (no invalid characters or repeated
  cards), each player''s hand is in no specific order, and in each hand there is a
  clear winner.'
- How many hands does Player 1 win?
