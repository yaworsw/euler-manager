:name: Find the largest 0 to 9 pandigital that can be formed by concatenating products
:url: http://projecteuler.net/problem=170
:content: "Take the number 6 and multiply it by each of 1273 and 9854:\n\n6 ![×](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_times.gif)
  1273 = 7638  \n\r6 ![×](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_times.gif)
  9854 = 59124\n\nBy concatenating these products we get the 1 to 9 pandigital 763859124.
  We will call 763859124 the \"concatenated product of 6 and (1273,9854)\". Notice
  too, that the concatenation of the input numbers, 612739854, is also 1 to 9 pandigital.\n\nThe
  same can be done for 0 to 9 pandigital numbers.\n\nWhat is the largest 0 to 9 pandigital
  10-digit concatenated product of an integer with two or more other integers, such
  that the concatenation of the input numbers is also a 0 to 9 pandigital 10-digit
  number?\n\n"
