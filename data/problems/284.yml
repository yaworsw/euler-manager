:content: "The 3-digit number 376 in the decimal numbering system is an example of
  numbers with the special property that its square ends with the same digits: 376<sup>2</sup>
  = 141376. Let's call a number with this property a steady square.\n\nSteady squares
  can also be observed in other numbering systems. In the base 14 numbering system,
  the 3-digit number c37 is also a steady square: c37<sup>2</sup> = aa0c37, and the
  sum of its digits is c+3+7=18 in the same numbering system. The letters a, b, c
  and d are used for the 10, 11, 12 and 13 digits respectively, in a manner similar
  to the hexadecimal numbering system.\n\nFor 1 ![也({{ images_dir }}/symbol_le.gif)
  n ![也({{ images_dir }}/symbol_le.gif) 9, the sum of the digits of all the n-digit
  steady squares in the base 14 numbering system is 2d8 (582 decimal). Steady squares
  with leading 0's are not allowed.\n\nFind the sum of the digits of all the n-digit
  steady squares in the base 14 numbering system for  \n\r1 ![也({{ images_dir }}/symbol_le.gif)
  n ![也({{ images_dir }}/symbol_le.gif) 10000 (decimal) and give your answer in the
  base 14 system using lower case letters where necessary.\n\n"
