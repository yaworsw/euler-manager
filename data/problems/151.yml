:name: 'Paper sheets of standard sizes: an expected-value problem'
:content: "\r\n<p>A printing shop runs 16 batches (jobs) every week and each batch
  requires a sheet of special colour-proofing paper of size A5.</p>\r\n<p>Every Monday
  morning, the foreman opens a new envelope, containing a large sheet of the special
  paper with size A1.</p>\r\n<p>He proceeds to cut it in half, thus getting two sheets
  of size A2. Then he cuts one of them in half to get two sheets of size A3 and so
  on until he obtains the A5-size sheet needed for the first batch of the week.</p>\r\n<p>All
  the unused sheets are placed back in the envelope.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img
  src=\"project/images/p_151.gif\" width=\"314\" height=\"227\" alt=\"\"></div>\r\n<p>At
  the beginning of each subsequent batch, he takes from the envelope one sheet of
  paper at random. If it is of size A5, he uses it. If it is larger, he repeats the
  'cut-in-half' procedure until he has what he needs and any remaining sheets are
  always placed back in the envelope.</p>\r\n<p>Excluding the first and last batch
  of the week, find the expected number of times (during each week) that the foreman
  finds a single sheet of paper in the envelope.</p>\r\n<p>Give your answer rounded
  to six decimal places using the format x.xxxxxx .</p>\r\n"
