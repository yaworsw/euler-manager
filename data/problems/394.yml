:content: "\r\n<p>\r\nJeff eats a pie in an unusual way.<br>\r\nThe pie is circular.
  He starts with slicing an initial cut in the pie along a radius.<br>\r\nWhile there
  is at least a given fraction <var>F</var> of pie left, he performs the following
  procedure:<br>\r\n- He makes two slices from the pie centre to any point of what
  is remaining of the pie border, any point on the remaining pie border equally likely.
  This will divide the remaining pie into three pieces.<br> \r\n- Going counterclockwise
  from the initial cut, he takes the first two pie pieces and eats them.<br>\r\nWhen
  less than a fraction <var>F</var> of pie remains, he does not repeat this procedure.
  Instead, he eats all of the remaining pie.\r\n</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img
