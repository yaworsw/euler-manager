- "Recall that a graph is a collection of vertices and edges connecting the vertices,
  and that two vertices connected by an edge are called adjacent.<br>\r\nGraphs can
  be embedded in Euclidean space by associating each vertex with a point in the Euclidean
  space.<br>\r\nA <strong>flexible</strong> graph is an embedding of a graph where
  it is possible to move one or more vertices continuously so that the distance between
  at least two nonadjacent vertices is altered while the distances between each pair
  of adjacent vertices is kept constant.<br>\r\nA <strong>rigid</strong> graph is
  an embedding of a graph which is not flexible.<br>\r\nInformally, a graph is rigid
  if by replacing the vertices with fully rotating hinges and the edges with rods
  that are unbending and inelastic, no parts of the graph can be moved independently
  from the rest of the graph.\r\n"
- The <strong>grid graphs</strong> embedded in the Euclidean plane are not rigid,
  as the following animation demonstrates:<br><img src="project/images/p434_rigid.gif">
- However, one can make them rigid by adding diagonal edges to the cells. For example,
  for the 2x3 grid graph, there are 19 ways to make the graph rigid:<br><img src="project/images/p434_rigid23.png">
- "Note that for the purposes of this problem, we do not consider changing the orientation
  of a diagonal edge or adding both diagonal edges to a cell as a different way of
  making a grid graph rigid.\r\n"
