  and Max are asked to transform two digital clocks into two \"digital root\" clocks.
  \ \n\rA digital root clock is a digital clock that calculates digital roots step
  by step.\n\nWhen a clock is fed a number, it will show it and then it will start
  the calculation, showing all the intermediate values until it gets to the result.
  \ \n\rFor example, if the clock is fed the number 137, it will show: \" **137**
  \" ![→](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_maps.gif) \" **11**
  \" ![→](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_maps.gif) \" **2**
  \" and then it will go black, waiting for the next number.\n\nEvery digital number
  consists of some light segments: three horizontal (top, middle, bottom) and four
  vertical (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).  \n\rNumber \" **1**
  \" is made of vertical top-right and bottom-right, number \" **4** \" is made by
  middle horizontal and vertical top-left, top-right and bottom-right. Number \" **8**
  \" lights them all.\n\nThe clocks consume energy only when segments are turned on/off.
  \ \n\rTo turn on a \" **2** \" will cost 5 transitions, while a \" **7** \" will
  cost only 4 transitions.\n\nSam and Max built two different clocks.\n\nSam's clock
  is fed e.g. number 137: the clock shows \" **137** \", then the panel is turned
  off, then the next number (\" **11** \") is turned on, then the panel is turned
  off again and finally the last number (\" **2** \") is turned on and, after some
  time, off.  \n\rFor the example, with number 137, Sam's clock requires:\n\n| \"
  **137** \" | : | (2 + 5 + 4) ![×](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_times.gif)
  2 = 22 transitions (\" **137** \" on/off). |\n| \" **11** \" | : | (2 + 2) ![×](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_times.gif)
  2 = 8 transitions (\" **11** \" on/off). |\n| \" **2** \" | : | (5) ![×](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_times.gif)
  2 = 10 transitions (\" **2** \" on/off). |\n\n\rFor a grand total of 40 transitions.\r\r\n\nMax's
  clock works differently. Instead of turning off the whole panel, it is smart enough
  to turn off only those segments that won't be needed for the next number.  \n\rFor
  number 137, Max's clock requires:\n\n| \" **137** \"  \n  \n  \n | :  \n  \n  \n
  | 2 + 5 + 4 = 11 transitions (\" **137** \" on)  \n\r7 transitions (to turn off
  the segments that are not needed for number \" **11** \"). |\n| \" **11** \"  \n
  \ \n  \n  \n  \n | :  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n | 0 transitions (number \" **11** \" is
  already turned on correctly)  \n\r3 transitions (to turn off the first \" **1**
  \" and the bottom part of the second \" **1** \";   \n\rthe top part is common with
  number \" **2** \"). |\n| \" **2** \"  \n  \n  \n | :  \n  \n  \n | 4 tansitions
  (to turn on the remaining segments in order to get a \" **2** \")  \n\r5 transitions
  (to turn off number \" **2** \"). |\n\n\rFor a grand total of 30 transitions.\r\r\n\nOf
  course, Max's clock consumes less power than Sam's one.  \n\rThe two clocks are
  fed all the prime numbers between A = 10<sup>7</sup> and B = 2 ![×](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_times.gif)10<sup>7</sup>.
  \  \n\rFind the difference between the total number of transitions needed by Sam's
  clock and that needed by Max's one.\n\n"
