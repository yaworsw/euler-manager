:content: "An m ![×](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_times.gif)n
  maze is an m ![×](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_times.gif)n
  rectangular grid with walls placed between grid cells such that there is exactly
  one path from the top-left square to any other square.   \nThe following are examples
  of a 9 ![×](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_times.gif)12
  maze and a 15 ![×](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_times.gif)20
  maze:\n\n![](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/p_380_mazes.gif)\n\nLet
  C(m,n) be the number of distinct m ![×](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_times.gif)n
  mazes. Mazes which can be formed by rotation and reflection from another maze are
  considered distinct.\n\nIt can be verified that C(1,1) = 1, C(2,2) = 4, C(3,4) =
  2415, and C(9,12) = 2.5720e46 (in scientific notation rounded to 5 significant digits).
  \ \n\rFind C(100,500) and write your answer in scientific notation rounded to 5
  significant digits.\n\nWhen giving your answer, use a lowercase e to separate mantissa
  and exponent.\rE.g. if the answer is 1234567891011 then the answer format would
  be 1.2346e12.\n\n"
