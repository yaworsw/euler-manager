- In a sliding game a counter may slide horizontally or vertically into an empty space.
  The objective of the game is to move the red counter from the top left corner of
  a grid to the bottom right corner; the space always starts in the bottom right corner.
  For example, the following sequence of pictures show how the game can be completed
  in five moves on a 2 by 2 grid.
- Let S(m,n) represent the minimum number of moves to complete the game on an m by
  n grid. For example, it can be verified that S(5,4) = 25.
- There are exactly 5482 grids for which S(m,n) = p<sup>2</sup>, where p <img src="images/symbol_lt.gif"
  width="10" height="10" alt="&lt;" border="0" style="vertical-align:middle;"> 100
  is prime.
- How many grids does S(m,n) = p<sup>2</sup>, where p <img src="images/symbol_lt.gif"
  width="10" height="10" alt="&lt;" border="0" style="vertical-align:middle;"> 10<sup>6</sup>
  is prime?
