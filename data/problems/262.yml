- 'The following equation represents the <i>continuous</i> topography of a mountainous
  region, giving the <dfn title="height above sea level">elevation</dfn> <var>h</var>
  at any point (<var>x</var>,<var>y</var>):'
- A mosquito intends to fly from A(200,200) to B(1400,1400), without leaving the area
  given by 0 ≤ <var>x</var>, <var>y</var> ≤ 1600.
- Because of the intervening mountains, it first rises straight up to a point A',
  having elevation <var>f</var>. Then, while remaining at the same elevation <var>f</var>,
  it flies around any obstacles until it arrives at a point B' directly above B.
- "First, determine <var>f<sub>min</sub></var> which is the minimum constant elevation
  allowing such a trip from A to B, while remaining in the specified area.<br>\r\nThen,
  find the length of the shortest path between A' and B', while flying at that constant
  elevation <var>f<sub>min</sub></var>."
- Give that length as your answer, rounded to three decimal places.
- "<font><u>Note</u>: For convenience, the elevation function shown above is repeated
  below, in a form suitable for most programming languages:<br>\r\nh=( 5000-0.005*(x*x+y*y+x*y)+12.5*(x+y)
  ) * exp( -abs(0.000001*(x*x+y*y)-0.0015*(x+y)+0.7) )</font>"
