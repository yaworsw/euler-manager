:content: "\r\n<p>By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent
  numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.</p>\r\n<p

  3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.</p>\r\n<p>Find the maximum total from top to bottom in <a href=\"project/triangle.txt\">triangle.txt</a>

  with one-hundred rows.</p>\r\n<p class=\"note\"><b>NOTE:</b> This is a much more
  difficult version of <a href=\"problem=18\">Problem 18</a>. It is not possible to
  try every route to solve this problem, as there are 2<sup>99</sup> altogether! If
  you could check one trillion (10<sup>12</sup>) routes every second it would take
  over twenty billion years to check them all. There is an efficient algorithm to
  solve it. ;o)</p>\r\n\r\n"
