:content: "A game is played with three piles of stones and two players.  \n\rAt her
  turn, a player removes one or more stones from the piles. However, if she takes
  stones from more than one pile, she must remove the same number of stones from each
  of the selected piles.\n\nIn other words, the player chooses some N>0 and removes:\n\n-
  N stones from any single pile; or\n- N stones from each of any two piles (2N total);
  or\n- N stones from each of the three piles (3N total).\n\rThe player taking the
  last stone(s) wins the game.\r\r\n\nA _winning configuration_ is one where the first
  player can force a win.  \n\rFor example, (0,0,13), (0,11,11) and (5,5,5) are winning
  configurations because the first player can immediately remove all stones.\n\nA
  _losing configuration_ is one where the second player can force a win, no matter
  what the first player does.  \n \rFor example, (0,1,2) and (1,3,3) are losing configurations:
  any legal move leaves a winning configuration for the second player.\n\nConsider
  all losing configurations (x<sub>i</sub>,y<sub>i</sub>,z<sub>i</sub>) where x<sub>i</sub>
  ![≤](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_le.gif) y<sub>i</sub>
  ![≤](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_le.gif) z<sub>i</sub>
  ![≤](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_le.gif) 100.  \n\rWe
  can verify that Σ(x<sub>i</sub>+y<sub>i</sub>+z<sub>i</sub>) = 173895 for these.\n\nFind
  Σ(x<sub>i</sub>+y<sub>i</sub>+z<sub>i</sub>) where (x<sub>i</sub>,y<sub>i</sub>,z<sub>i</sub>)
  ranges over the losing configurations  \n\rwith x<sub>i</sub> ![≤](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_le.gif)
  y<sub>i</sub> ![≤](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_le.gif)
  z<sub>i</sub> ![≤](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_le.gif)
  1000.\n\n"
