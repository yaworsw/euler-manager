:content: "\r\n<p>2<sup>N</sup> binary digits can be placed in a circle so that all
  the N-digit clockwise subsequences are distinct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For N=3, two such
  circular arrangements are possible, ignoring rotations:</p>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img
  src=\"project/images/p_265_BinaryCircles.gif\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>For the first arrangement,
  the 3-digit subsequences, in clockwise order, are:<br> 000, 001, 010, 101, 011,
  111, 110 and 100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each circular arrangement can be encoded as a number
  by concatenating the binary digits starting with the subsequence of all zeros as
  the most significant bits and proceeding clockwise. The two arrangements for N=3
  are thus represented as 23 and 29:\r\n</p>\n<div align=\"center\">00010111 <sub>2</sub>
  = 23</div>\r\n<div align=\"center\">00011101 <sub>2</sub> = 29</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Calling
  S(N) the sum of the unique numeric representations, we can see that S(3) = 23 +
  29 = 52.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find S(5).</p>\r\n\r\n"
