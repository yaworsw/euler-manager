:content: "\r\n<p>A <b>Harshad or Niven number</b> is a number that is divisible by
  the sum of its digits.\r\n<br>201 is a Harshad number because it is divisible by
  3 (the sum of its digits.)\r\n<br>When we truncate the last digit from 201, we get
  20, which is a Harshad number.\r\n<br>When we truncate the last digit from 20, we
  get 2, which is also a Harshad number.\r\n<br>Let's call a Harshad number that,
  while recursively truncating the last digit, always results in a Harshad number
  a <i>right truncatable Harshad number.</i></p>  \r\n\r\n<p>Also:\r\n<br>201/3=67
  which is prime.\r\n<br>Let's call a Harshad number that, when divided by the sum
  of its digits, results in a prime a <i>strong Harshad number</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now
  take the number 2011 which is prime.\r\n<br>When we truncate the last digit from
  it we get 201, a strong Harshad number that is also right truncatable.\r\n<br>Let's
  call such primes <i>strong, right truncatable Harshad primes</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You
  are given that the sum of the strong, right truncatable Harshad primes less than
  10000 is 90619.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find the sum of the strong, right truncatable Harshad
  primes less than 10<sup>14</sup>.</p>\r\n"
