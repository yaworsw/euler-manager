:content:
- "\r\nInside a rope of length <var>n</var>, <var>n</var>-1 points are placed with
  distance 1 from each other and from the endpoints. Among these points, we choose
  <var>m</var>-1 points at random and cut the rope at these points to create <var>m</var>
  segments.\r\n"
- "\r\nLet E(<var>n</var>, <var>m</var>) be the expected length of the second-shortest
  segment.\r\nFor example, E(3, 2) = 2 and E(8, 3) = 16/7.\r\nNote that if multiple
  segments have the same shortest length the length of the second-shortest segment
  is defined as the same as the shortest length.\r\n"
- "\r\nFind E(10<sup>7</sup>, 100).\r\nGive your answer rounded to 5 decimal places
  behind the decimal point.\r\n"
