- "\r\n<var>k</var> defects are randomly distributed amongst <var>n</var> integrated-circuit
  chips produced by a factory (any number of defects may be found on a chip and each
  defect is independent of the other defects).\r\n"

  least 3 defects.<br>\r\nFor instance p(3,7) <img src=\"images/symbol_asymp.gif\"
