:content: "<var>k</var> defects are randomly distributed amongst <var>n</var> integrated-circuit
  chips produced by a factory (any number of defects may be found on a chip and each
  defect is independent of the other defects).\n\nLet p(<var>k,n</var>) represent
  the probability that there is a chip with at least 3 defects.  \n\rFor instance
  p(3,7) ![≈]({{ images_dir }}/symbol_asymp.gif) 0.0204081633.\n\nFind p(20 000, 1
  000 000) and give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places in the form 0.abcdefghij\n\n"
