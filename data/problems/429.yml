:content:
- "\r\nA unitary divisor <var>d</var> of a number <var>n</var> is a divisor of <var>n</var>
  that has the property gcd(<var>d, n/d</var>) = 1.<br>\r\nThe unitary divisors of
  4! = 24 are 1, 3, 8 and 24.<br>\r\nThe sum of their squares is 1<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>
  + 8<sup>2</sup> + 24<sup>2</sup> = 650.\r\n"
- "\r\nLet S(<var>n</var>) represent the sum of the squares of the unitary divisors
  of <var>n</var>. Thus S(4!)=650.\r\n"
- "\r\nFind S(100 000 000!) modulo 1 000 000 009.\r\n"
