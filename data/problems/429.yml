:url: https://projecteuler.net/problem=429
:content: "A unitary divisor <var>d</var> of a number <var>n</var> is a divisor of
  <var>n</var> that has the property gcd(<var>d, n/d</var>) = 1.  \nThe unitary divisors
  of 4! = 24 are 1, 3, 8 and 24.  \nThe sum of their squares is 1<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>
  + 8<sup>2</sup> + 24<sup>2</sup> = 650.\n\nLet S(<var>n</var>) represent the sum
  of the squares of the unitary divisors of <var>n</var>. Thus S(4!)=650.\n\nFind
  S(100 000 000!) modulo 1 000 000 009.\n\n"
