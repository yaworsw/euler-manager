:content: "\r\n\n<p>Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written
  as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:</p>\n<blockquote>1634 = 1<sup>4</sup>
  + 6<sup>4</sup> + 3<sup>4</sup> + 4<sup>4</sup><br>\n8208 = 8<sup>4</sup> + 2<sup>4</sup>
  + 0<sup>4</sup> + 8<sup>4</sup><br>\n9474 = 9<sup>4</sup> + 4<sup>4</sup> + 7<sup>4</sup>
  + 4<sup>4</sup>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"info\">As 1 = 1<sup>4</sup> is not a
  sum it is not included.</p>\n<p>The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 =
  19316.</p>\n<p>Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of
  fifth powers of their digits.</p>\n\r\n"
