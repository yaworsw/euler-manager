:name: Lychrel numbers
:content: "\r\n<p>If we take 47, reverse and add, 47 + 74 = 121, which is palindromic.</p>\r\n<p>Not
  all numbers produce palindromes so quickly. For example,</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:50px;\">349
  + 943 = 1292,<br>\r\n1292 + 2921 = 4213<br>\r\n4213 + 3124 = 7337</p>\r\n<p>That
  is, 349 took three iterations to arrive at a palindrome.</p>\r\n<p>Although no one
  has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers, like 196, never produce a palindrome.
  A number that never forms a palindrome through the reverse and add process is called
  a Lychrel number. Due to the theoretical nature of these numbers, and for the purpose
  of this problem, we shall assume that a number is Lychrel until proven otherwise.
  In addition you are given that for every number below ten-thousand, it will either
  (i) become a palindrome in less than fifty iterations, or, (ii) no one, with all
  the computing power that exists, has managed so far to map it to a palindrome. In
  fact, 10677 is the first number to be shown to require over fifty iterations before
  producing a palindrome: 4668731596684224866951378664 (53 iterations, 28-digits).</p>\r\n<p>Surprisingly,
  there are palindromic numbers that are themselves Lychrel numbers; the first example
  is 4994.</p>\r\n<p>How many Lychrel numbers are there below ten-thousand?</p>\r\n<p

  the theoretical nature of Lychrel numbers.</p>\r\n"
