:name: Almost equilateral triangles
:content: "\r\n<p>It is easily proved that no equilateral triangle exists with integral
  length sides and integral area. However, the <i>almost equilateral triangle</i>
  5-5-6 has an area of 12 square units.</p>\r\n<p>We shall define an <i>almost equilateral
  triangle</i> to be a triangle for which two sides are equal and the third differs
  by no more than one unit.</p>\r\n<p>Find the sum of the perimeters of all <i>almost
  equilateral triangles</i> with integral side lengths and area and whose perimeters
  do not exceed one billion (1,000,000,000).</p>\r\n\r\n"
