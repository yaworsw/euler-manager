:content: "\r\n<p>Using all of the digits 1 through 9 and concatenating them freely
  to form decimal integers, different sets can be formed. Interestingly with the set
  {2,5,47,89,631}, all of the elements belonging to it are prime.</p>\r\n<p>How many
  distinct sets containing each of the digits one through nine exactly once contain
  only prime elements?</p>\r\n\r\n"
