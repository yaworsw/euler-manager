:content: "\r\n<p>Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit
  to its left it is called an increasing number; for example, 134468.</p>\r\n<p>Similarly
  if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called a decreasing number;
  for example, 66420.</p>\r\n<p>We shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing
  nor decreasing a \"bouncy\" number; for example, 155349.</p>\r\n<p>Clearly there
  cannot be any bouncy numbers below one-hundred, but just over half of the numbers
  below one-thousand (525) are bouncy. In fact, the least number for which the proportion
  of bouncy numbers first reaches 50% is 538.</p>\r\n<p>Surprisingly, bouncy numbers
  become more and more common and by the time we reach 21780 the proportion of bouncy
  numbers is equal to 90%.</p>\r\n<p>Find the least number for which the proportion
  of bouncy numbers is exactly 99%.</p>\r\n\r\n"
