  Every triangle has a circumscribed circle that goes through the three vertices. Consider all integer sided triangles for which the radius of the circumscribed circle is integral as well.

  Let S(<var>n</var>) be the sum of the radii of the circumscribed circles of all such triangles for which the radius does not exceed <var>n</var>.

  S(100)=4950 and S(1200)=1653605.

  Find S(10<sup>7</sup>).
