:content: "Let's call S the (infinite) string that is made by concatenating the consecutive
  positive integers (starting from 1) written down in base 10.  \n Thus, S = 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242...\n\nIt's
  easy to see that any number will show up an infinite number of times in S.\n\nLet's
  call f(n) the starting position of the n<sup>th</sup> occurrence of n in S.  \n
  For example, f(1)=1, f(5)=81, f(12)=271 and f(7780)=111111365.\n\nFind ∑f(3<sup>k</sup>)
  for 1≤k≤13.\n\n"
