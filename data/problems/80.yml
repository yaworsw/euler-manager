:content: "\r\n\n<p>It is well known that if the square root of a natural number is
  not an integer, then it is irrational. The decimal expansion of such square roots
  is infinite without any repeating pattern at all.</p>\n<p>The square root of two
  is 1.41421356237309504880..., and the digital sum of the first one hundred decimal
  digits is 475.</p>\n<p>For the first one hundred natural numbers, find the total
  of the digital sums of the first one hundred decimal digits for all the irrational
  square roots.</p>\n\r\n"
