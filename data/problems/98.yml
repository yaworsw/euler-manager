:content: "\r\n<p>By replacing each of the letters in the word CARE with 1, 2, 9,
  and 6 respectively, we form a square number: 1296 = 36<sup>2</sup>. What is remarkable
  is that, by using the same digital substitutions, the anagram, RACE, also forms
  a square number: 9216 = 96<sup>2</sup>. We shall call CARE (and RACE) a square anagram
  word pair and specify further that leading zeroes are not permitted, neither may
  a different letter have the same digital value as another letter.</p>\r\n<p>Using
  <a href=\"project/words.txt\">words.txt</a> (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'),
  a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, find all the
  square anagram word pairs (a palindromic word is NOT considered to be an anagram
  of itself).</p>\r\n<p>What is the largest square number formed by any member of
  such a pair?</p>\r\n<p class=\"info\">NOTE: All anagrams formed must be contained
  in the given text file.</p>\r\n\r\n"
