:content: "We shall define a _pythagorean polygon_ to be a **convex polygon** with
  the following properties:\n\n- there are at least three vertices,\n- no three vertices
  are aligned,\n- each vertex has **integer coordinates** ,\n- each edge has **integer
  length** .\n\nFor a given integer <var>n</var>, define P(<var>n</var>) as the number
  of distinct pythagorean polygons for which the perimeter is ![≤]({{ images_dir }}/symbol_le.gif) <var>n</var>.
  \ \n\rPythagorean polygons should be considered distinct as long as none is a translation
  of another.\n\nYou are given that P(4) = 1, P(30) = 3655 and P(60) = 891045.  \n\rFind
  P(120).\n\n"
