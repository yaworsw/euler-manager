:name: Integer sided triangles for which the  area/perimeter ratio is integral
:url: http://projecteuler.net/problem=283
:content: "\r\n<p>\r\nConsider the triangle with sides 6, 8 and 10. It can be seen
  that the perimeter and the area are both equal to 24. \r\nSo the area/perimeter
  ratio is equal to 1.<br>\r\nConsider also the triangle with sides 13, 14 and 15.
  The perimeter equals 42 while the area is equal to 84. \r\nSo for this triangle
  the area/perimeter ratio is equal to 2.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFind the sum of the perimeters
  of all integer sided triangles for which the area/perimeter ratios are equal to
  positive integers not exceeding 1000.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n"
