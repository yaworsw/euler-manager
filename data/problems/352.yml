:content: "Each one of the 25 sheep in a flock must be tested for a rare virus, known
  to affect 2% of the sheep population.\rAn accurate and extremely sensitive PCR test
  exists for blood samples, producing a clear positive / negative result, but it is
  very time-consuming and expensive.\n\nBecause of the high cost, the vet-in-charge
  suggests that instead of performing 25 separate tests, the following procedure can
  be used instead:  \n  \n  \n\rThe sheep are split into 5 groups of 5 sheep in each
  group. \rFor each group, the 5 samples are mixed together and a single test is performed.
  Then,\n\n- If the result is negative, all the sheep in that group are deemed to
  be virus-free.\n- If the result is positive, 5 additional tests will be performed
  (a separate test for each animal) to determine the affected individual(s).\n\nSince
  the probability of infection for any specific animal is only 0.02, the first test
  (on the pooled samples) for each group will be:\n\n- Negative (and no more tests
  needed) with probability 0.98<sup>5</sup> = 0.9039207968.\n- Positive (5 additional
  tests needed) with probability 1 - 0.9039207968 = 0.0960792032.\n\nThus, the expected
  number of tests for each group is 1 + 0.0960792032 ![×](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_times.gif)
  5 = 1.480396016.  \n\rConsequently, all 5 groups can be screened using an average
  of only 1.480396016 ![×](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_times.gif)
  5 = **7.40198008** tests, which represents a huge saving of more than 70% !\n\nAlthough
  the scheme we have just described seems to be very efficient, it can still be improved
  considerably (always assuming that the test is sufficiently sensitive and that there
  are no adverse effects caused by mixing different samples). E.g.:\n\n- We may start
  by running a test on a mixture of all the 25 samples. It can be verified that in
  about 60.35% of the cases this test will be negative, thus no more tests will be
  needed. Further testing will only be required for the remaining 39.65% of the cases.\n-
  If we know that at least one animal in a group of 5 is infected and the first 4
  individual tests come out negative, there is no need to run a test on the fifth
  animal (we know that it must be infected).\n- We can try a different number of groups
  / different number of animals in each group, adjusting those numbers at each level
  so that the total expected number of tests will be minimised.\n\nTo simplify the
  very wide range of possibilities, there is one restriction we place when devising
  the most cost-efficient testing scheme: whenever we start with a mixed sample, all
  the sheep contributing to that sample must be fully screened (i.e. a verdict of
  infected / virus-free must be reached for all of them) before we start examining
  any other animals.\n\n\rFor the current example, it turns out that the most cost-efficient
  testing scheme (we'll call it the _optimal strategy_) requires an average of just
  **4.155452** tests!\r\r\r\n\nUsing the optimal strategy, let T(<var>s</var>,<var>p</var>)
  represent the average number of tests needed to screen a flock of <var>s</var> sheep
  for a virus having probability <var>p</var> to be present in any individual.  \n\rThus,
  rounded to six decimal places, T(25, 0.02) = 4.155452 and T(25, 0.10) = 12.702124.\n\nFind
  ΣT(10000, p) for p=0.01, 0.02, 0.03, ... 0.50.  \n\rGive your answer rounded to
  six decimal places.\n\n"
