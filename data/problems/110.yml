:content: "In the following equation <var>x</var>, <var>y</var>, and <var>n</var>
  are positive integers.\n\n| \n1  \n ![]({{ images_dir }}/blackdot.gif)  \n <var>x</var>\n
  | + | \n1  \n ![]({{ images_dir }}/blackdot.gif)  \n <var>y</var>\n | = | \n1  \n
  ![]({{ images_dir }}/blackdot.gif)  \n <var>n</var>\n |\n\nIt can be verified that
  when <var>n</var> = 1260 there are 113 distinct solutions and this is the least
  value of <var>n</var> for which the total number of distinct solutions exceeds one
  hundred.\n\nWhat is the least value of <var>n</var> for which the number of distinct
  solutions exceeds four million?\n\nNOTE: This problem is a much more difficult version
  of [Problem 108](problem=108) and as it is well beyond the limitations of a brute
  force approach it requires a clever implementation.\n\n"
