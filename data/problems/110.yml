:content:
- In the following equation <var>x</var>, <var>y</var>, and <var>n</var> are positive
  integers.
- It can be verified that when <var>n</var> = 1260 there are 113 distinct solutions
  and this is the least value of <var>n</var> for which the total number of distinct
  solutions exceeds one hundred.
- What is the least value of <var>n</var> for which the number of distinct solutions
  exceeds four million?
- 'NOTE: This problem is a much more difficult version of problem <a href="index.php?section=problems&amp;id=108">108</a>
  and as it is well beyond the limitations of a brute force approach it requires a
  clever implementation.'
