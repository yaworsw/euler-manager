:name: Pythagorean tiles
:content:
- Let (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>) represent the three sides of a right angle triangle
  with integral length sides. It is possible to place four such triangles together
  to form a square with length <i>c</i>.
- For example, (3, 4, 5) triangles can be placed together to form a 5 by 5 square
  with a 1 by 1 hole in the middle and it can be seen that the 5 by 5 square can be
  tiled with twenty-five 1 by 1 squares.
- However, if (5, 12, 13) triangles were used then the hole would measure 7 by 7 and
  these could not be used to tile the 13 by 13 square.
- Given that the perimeter of the right triangle is less than one-hundred million,
  how many Pythagorean triangles would allow such a tiling to take place?
