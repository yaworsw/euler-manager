  style="vertical-align:middle;"> 1000, such that a triangle is formed.
- 'Consider the following two triangles:'
- |-
  A(-340,495), B(-153,-910), C(835,-947)<br><br>
  X(-175,41), Y(-421,-714), Z(574,-645)
- It can be verified that triangle ABC contains the origin, whereas triangle XYZ does
  not.
- Using <a href="project/triangles.txt">triangles.txt</a> (right click and 'Save Link/Target
  As...'), a 27K text file containing the co-ordinates of one thousand "random" triangles,
  find the number of triangles for which the interior contains the origin.
- 'NOTE: The first two examples in the file represent the triangles in the example
  given above.'
