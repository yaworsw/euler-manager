:name: Scoring probabilities
:content:
- Barbara is a mathematician and a basketball player. She has found that the probability
  of scoring a point when shooting from a distance <var>x</var> is exactly (1 - <sup><var>x</var></sup>/<sub><var>q</var></sub>),
  where <var>q</var> is a real constant greater than 50.
- During each practice run, she takes shots from distances <var>x</var> = 1, <var>x</var> = 2,
  ..., <var>x</var> = 50 and, according to her records, she has precisely a 2 % chance
  to score a total of exactly 20 points.
- Find <var>q</var> and give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places.
