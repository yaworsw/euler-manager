:content: "\r\n<p>Barbara is a mathematician and a basketball player. She has found
  that the probability of scoring a point when shooting from a distance <var>x</var>
  is exactly (1 - <sup><var>x</var></sup>/<sub><var>q</var></sub>), where <var>q</var>
  is a real constant greater than 50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During each practice run, she
  takes shots from distances <var>x</var> = 1, <var>x</var> = 2, ..., <var>x</var> = 50
  and, according to her records, she has precisely a 2 % chance to score a total of
  exactly 20 points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find <var>q</var> and give your answer rounded
  to 10 decimal places.</p>\r\n"
