:content: "For each integer <var>p</var> ![>](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_gt.gif)
  1 coprime to 10 there is a positive _divisibility multiplier_ <var>m</var> ![<](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_lt.gif)
  <var>p</var> which preserves divisibility by <var>p</var> for the following function
  on any positive integer, <var>n</var>:\n\n<var>f</var>(<var>n</var>) = (all but
  the last digit of <var>n</var>) + (the last digit of <var>n</var>) \\* <var>m</var>\n\nThat
  is, if <var>m</var> is the divisibility multiplier for <var>p</var>, then <var>f</var>(<var>n</var>)
  is divisible by <var>p</var> if and only if <var>n</var> is divisible by <var>p</var>.\n\n(When
  <var>n</var> is much larger than <var>p</var>, <var>f</var>(<var>n</var>) will be
  less than <var>n</var> and repeated application of <var>f</var> provides a multiplicative
  divisibility test for <var>p</var>.)\n\nFor example, the divisibility multiplier
  for 113 is 34.\n\n<var>f</var>(76275) = 7627 + 5 \\* 34 = 7797 : 76275 and 7797
  are both divisible by 113  \n<var>f</var>(12345) = 1234 + 5 \\* 34 = 1404 : 12345
  and 1404 are both not divisible by 113\n\nThe sum of the divisibility multipliers
  for the primes that are coprime to 10 and less than 1000 is 39517. What is the sum
  of the divisibility multipliers for the primes that are coprime to 10 and less than
  10<sup>7</sup>?\n\n"
