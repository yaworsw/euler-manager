:name: Cube digit pairs
:content: "\r\n<p>Each of the six faces on a cube has a different digit (0 to 9) written
  on it; the same is done to a second cube. By placing the two cubes side-by-side
  in different positions we can form a variety of 2-digit numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For
  example, the square number 64 could be formed:</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\r\n<img
  src=\"project/images/p_090.gif\" alt=\"\"><br>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, by carefully
  choosing the digits on both cubes it is possible to display all of the square numbers
  below one-hundred: 01, 04, 09, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, and 81.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example,
  one way this can be achieved is by placing {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} on one cube and {1,
  2, 3, 4, 8, 9} on the other cube.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, for this problem we shall
  allow the 6 or 9 to be turned upside-down so that an arrangement like {0, 5, 6,
  7, 8, 9} and {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7} allows for all nine square numbers to be displayed;
  otherwise it would be impossible to obtain 09.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In determining a distinct
  arrangement we are interested in the digits on each cube, not the order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p
  style=\"margin-left:50px;\">{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is equivalent to {3, 6, 4, 1, 2,
  5}<br>\r\n{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is distinct from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9}</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But
  because we are allowing 6 and 9 to be reversed, the two distinct sets in the last
  example both represent the extended set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9} for the purpose of
  forming 2-digit numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How many distinct arrangements of the two
  cubes allow for all of the square numbers to be displayed?</p>\r\n"
