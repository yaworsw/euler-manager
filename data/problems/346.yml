:content: "\r\n<p>\r\nThe number 7 is special, because 7 is 111 written in base 2,
  and 11 written in base 6 <br>(i.e. 7<sub>10</sub> = 11<sub>6</sub> = 111<sub>2</sub>).
  In other words, 7 is a repunit in at least two bases b &gt; 1. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe
  shall call a positive integer with this property a strong repunit. It can be verified
  that there are 8 strong repunits below 50:  {1,7,13,15,21,31,40,43}. <br>Furthermore,
  the sum of all strong repunits below 1000 equals 15864.\r\n</p>\r\nFind the sum
  of all strong repunits below 10<sup>12</sup>.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
