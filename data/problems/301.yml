:content: "\r\n<p><i>Nim</i> is a game played with heaps of stones, where two players
  take it in turn to remove any number of stones from any heap until no stones remain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We'll
  consider the three-heap normal-play version of Nim, which works as follows:<br>\r\n-
  At the start of the game there are three heaps of stones.<br>\r\n- On his turn the
  player removes any positive number of stones from any single heap.<br>\r\n- The
  first player unable to move (because no stones remain) loses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> If
  (<var>n</var><sub>1</sub>,<var>n</var><sub>2</sub>,<var>n</var><sub>3</sub>) indicates
  a Nim position consisting of heaps of size <var>n</var><sub>1</sub>, <var>n</var><sub>2</sub>
  and <var>n</var><sub>3</sub> then there is a simple function <var>X</var>(<var>n</var><sub>1</sub>,<var>n</var><sub>2</sub>,<var>n</var><sub>3</sub>)
  — that you may look up or attempt to deduce for yourself — that returns:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>zero
  if, with perfect strategy, the player about to move will eventually lose; or</li>\r\n<li>non-zero
  if, with perfect strategy, the player about to move will eventually win.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For
  example <var>X</var>(1,2,3) = 0 because, no matter what the current player does,
  his opponent can respond with a move that leaves two heaps of equal size, at which
  point every move by the current player can be mirrored by his opponent until no
  stones remain; so the current player loses. To illustrate:<br>\r\n- current player
  moves to (1,2,1)<br>\r\n- opponent moves to (1,0,1)<br>\r\n- current player moves
  to (0,0,1)<br>\r\n- opponent moves to (0,0,0), and so wins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For how
  many positive integers <var>n</var> <img src=\"images/symbol_le.gif\" width=\"10\"

  does <var>X</var>(<var>n</var>,2<var>n</var>,3<var>n</var>) = 0 ?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n"
