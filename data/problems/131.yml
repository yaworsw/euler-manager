:content: "\r\n<p>There are some prime values, <i>p</i>, for which there exists a
  positive integer, <i>n</i>, such that the expression <i>n</i><sup>3</sup> + <i>n</i><sup>2</sup><i>p</i>
  is a perfect cube.</p>\r\n<p>For example, when <i>p</i> = 19, 8<sup>3</sup> + 8<sup>2</sup><img
  src=\"images/symbol_times.gif\" width=\"9\" height=\"9\" alt=\"×\" border=\"0\"
  style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">19 = 12<sup>3</sup>.</p>\r\n<p>What is perhaps
  most surprising is that for each prime with this property the value of <i>n</i>
  is unique, and there are only four such primes below one-hundred.</p>\r\n<p>How
  many primes below one million have this remarkable property?</p>\r\n\r\n"
