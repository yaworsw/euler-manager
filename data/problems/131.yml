  There are some prime values, _p_, for which there exists a positive integer, _n_, such that the expression _n_<sup>3</sup> + _n_<sup>2</sup>_p_ is a perfect cube.

  For example, when _p_ = 19, 8<sup>3</sup> + 8<sup>2</sup> ![×]({{ images_dir }}/symbol_times.gif)19 = 12<sup>3</sup>.

  What is perhaps most surprising is that for each prime with this property the value of _n_ is unique, and there are only four such primes below one-hundred.

  How many primes below one million have this remarkable property?
