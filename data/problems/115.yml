:content: "\r\n<p class=\"info\">NOTE: This is a more difficult version of problem
  <a href=\"index.php?section=problems&amp;id=114\">114</a>.</p>\r\n<p>A row measuring
  <i>n</i> units in length has red blocks with a minimum length of <i>m</i> units
  placed on it, such that any two red blocks (which are allowed to be different lengths)
  are separated by at least one black square.</p>\r\n<p>Let the fill-count function,
  F(<i>m</i>, <i>n</i>), represent the number of ways that a row can be filled.</p>\r\n<p>For
  example, F(3, 29) = 673135 and F(3, 30) = 1089155.</p>\r\n<p>That is, for <i>m</i>
  = 3, it can be seen that <i>n</i> = 30 is the smallest value for which the fill-count
  function first exceeds one million.</p>\r\n<p>In the same way, for <i>m</i> = 10,
  it can be verified that F(10, 56) = 880711 and F(10, 57) = 1148904, so <i>n</i>
  = 57 is the least value for which the fill-count function first exceeds one million.</p>\r\n<p>For
  <i>m</i> = 50, find the least value of <i>n</i> for which the fill-count function
  first exceeds one million.</p>\r\n\r\n"
