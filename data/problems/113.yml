:content: "\r\n\n<p>Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit
  to its left it is called an increasing number; for example, 134468.</p>\n<p>Similarly
  if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called a decreasing number;
  for example, 66420.</p>\n<p>We shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing
  nor decreasing a \"bouncy\" number; for example, 155349.</p>\n<p>As <i>n</i> increases,
  the proportion of bouncy numbers below <i>n</i> increases such that there are only
  12951 numbers below one-million that are not bouncy and only 277032 non-bouncy numbers
  below 10<sup>10</sup>.</p>\n<p>How many numbers below a googol (10<sup>100</sup>)
  are not bouncy?</p>\n\r\n"
