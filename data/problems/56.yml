  A googol (10<sup>100</sup>) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros; 100<sup>100</sup> is almost unimaginably large: one followed by two-hundred zeros. Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each number is only 1.

  Considering natural numbers of the form, _a<sup>b</sup>_, where _a, b_ ![<](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_lt.gif) 100, what is the maximum digital sum?
