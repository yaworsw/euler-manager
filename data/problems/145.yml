:name: How many reversible numbers are there below one-billion?
:url: http://projecteuler.net/problem=145
:content: "\r\n<p>Some positive integers <i>n</i> have the property that the sum [
  <i>n</i> + reverse(<i>n</i>) ] consists entirely of odd (decimal) digits. For instance,
  36 + 63 = 99 and 409 + 904 = 1313. We will call such numbers <em>reversible</em>;
  so 36, 63, 409, and 904 are reversible. Leading zeroes are not allowed in either
  <i>n</i> or reverse(<i>n</i>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are 120 reversible numbers below
  one-thousand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How many reversible numbers are there below one-billion
  (10<sup>9</sup>)?</p>\r\n"
