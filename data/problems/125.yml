:content: "\r\n\n<p>The palindromic number 595 is interesting because it can be written
  as the sum of consecutive squares: 6<sup>2</sup> + 7<sup>2</sup> + 8<sup>2</sup>
  + 9<sup>2</sup> + 10<sup>2</sup> + 11<sup>2</sup> + 12<sup>2</sup>.</p>\n<p>There
  are exactly eleven palindromes below one-thousand that can be written as consecutive
  square sums, and the sum of these palindromes is 4164. Note that 1 = 0<sup>2</sup>
  + 1<sup>2</sup> has not been included as this problem is concerned with the squares
  of positive integers.</p>\n<p>Find the sum of all the numbers less than 10<sup>8</sup>
  that are both palindromic and can be written as the sum of consecutive squares.</p>\n\r\n"
