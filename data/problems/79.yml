:content: "\r\n<p>A common security method used for online banking is to ask the user
  for three random characters from a passcode. For example, if the passcode was 531278,
  they may ask for the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th characters; the expected reply would be:
  317.</p>\r\n<p>The text file, <a href=\"project/keylog.txt\">keylog.txt</a>, contains
  fifty successful login attempts.</p>\r\n<p>Given that the three characters are always
  asked for in order, analyse the file so as to determine the shortest possible secret
  passcode of unknown length.</p>\r\n\r\n"
