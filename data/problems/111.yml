- 'Considering 4-digit primes containing repeated digits it is clear that they cannot
  all be the same: 1111 is divisible by 11, 2222 is divisible by 22, and so on. But
  there are nine 4-digit primes containing three ones:'
- 1117, 1151, 1171, 1181, 1511, 1811, 2111, 4111, 8111
- We shall say that M(<i>n</i>, <i>d</i>) represents the maximum number of repeated
  digits for an <i>n</i>-digit prime where <i>d</i> is the repeated digit, N(<i>n</i>,
  <i>d</i>) represents the number of such primes, and S(<i>n</i>, <i>d</i>) represents
  the sum of these primes.
- So M(4, 1) = 3 is the maximum number of repeated digits for a 4-digit prime where
  one is the repeated digit, there are N(4, 1) = 9 such primes, and the sum of these
  primes is S(4, 1) = 22275. It turns out that for <i>d</i> = 0, it is only possible
  to have M(4, 0) = 2 repeated digits, but there are N(4, 0) = 13 such cases.
- In the same way we obtain the following results for 4-digit primes.
- For <i>d</i> = 0 to 9, the sum of all S(4, <i>d</i>) is 273700.
- Find the sum of all S(10, <i>d</i>).
