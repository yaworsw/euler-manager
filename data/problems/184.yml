- Consider the set <var>I<sub>r</sub></var> of points (<var>x</var>,<var>y</var>)
  with integer co-ordinates in the interior of the circle with radius <var>r</var>,
  centered at the origin, i.e. <var>x</var><sup>2</sup> + <var>y</var><sup>2</sup><img
  src="images/symbol_lt.gif" width="10" height="10" alt="&lt;" border="0" style="vertical-align:middle;"><var>r</var><sup>2</sup>.
- For a radius of 2, <var>I</var><sub>2</sub> contains the nine points (0,0), (1,0),
  (1,1), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (-1,-1), (0,-1) and (1,-1). There are eight triangles
  having all three vertices in <var>I</var><sub>2</sub> which contain the origin in
  the interior. Two of them are shown below, the others are obtained from these by
  rotation.

- For a radius of 3, there are 360 triangles containing the origin in the interior
  and having all vertices in <var>I</var><sub>3</sub> and for <var>I</var><sub>5</sub>
  the number is 10600.
- How many triangles are there containing the origin in the interior and having all
  three vertices in <var>I</var><sub>105</sub>?
