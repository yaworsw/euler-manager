:content: "\r\n<p>We say that a <var>d</var>-digit positive number (no leading zeros)
  is a one-child number if exactly one of its sub-strings is divisible by <var>d</var>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For
  example, 5671 is a 4-digit one-child number. Among all its sub-strings 5, 6, 7,
  1, 56, 67, 71, 567, 671 and 5671, only 56 is divisible by 4.<br>\r\nSimilarly, 104
  is a 3-digit one-child number because only 0 is divisible by 3.<br>\r\n1132451 is
  a 7-digit one-child number because only 245 is divisible by 7.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let
  F(<var>N</var>) be the number of the one-child numbers less than <var>N</var>.<br>\r\nWe
  can verify that F(10) = 9, F(10<sup>3</sup>) = 389 and F(10<sup>7</sup>) = 277674.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find
  F(10<sup>19</sup>).</p>\r\n"
