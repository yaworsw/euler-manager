:content: "\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Bozo sort</b>, not to be confused with the slightly less
  efficient <b>bogo sort</b>, consists out of checking if the input sequence is sorted
  and if not swapping randomly two elements. This is repeated until eventually the
  sequence is sorted.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIf we consider all permutations of the first
  4 natural numbers as input the expectation value of the number of swaps, averaged
  over all 4! input sequences is 24.75.<br>\r\nThe already sorted sequence takes 0
  steps. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn this problem we consider the following variant on bozo
  sort.<br>\r\nIf the sequence is not in order we pick three elements at random and
  shuffle these three elements randomly.<br>\r\nAll 3!=6 permutations of those three
  elements are equally likely. <br>\r\nThe already sorted sequence will take 0 steps.<br>\r\nIf
  we consider all permutations of the first 4 natural numbers as input the expectation
  value of the number of shuffles, averaged over all 4! input sequences is 27.5. <br>\r\nConsider
  as input sequences the permutations of the first 11 natural numbers.<br>\r\nAveraged
  over all 11! input sequences, what is the expected number of shuffles this sorting
  algorithm will perform?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nGive your answer rounded to the nearest
  integer.\r\n</p>\r\n"
