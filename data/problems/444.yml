:name: The Roundtable Lottery
:content:
- A group of <var>p</var> people decide to sit down at a round table and play a lottery-ticket
  trading game. Each person starts off with a randomly-assigned, unscratched lottery
  ticket. Each ticket, when scratched, reveals a whole-pound prize ranging anywhere
  from £1 to £<var>p</var>, with no two tickets alike. The goal of the game is for
  each person to maximize his ticket winnings upon leaving the game.
- 'An arbitrary person is chosen to be the first player. Going around the table, each
  player has only one of two options:'
- "1. The player can scratch his ticket and reveal its worth to everyone at the table.<br>\r\n2.
  The player can trade his unscratched ticket for a previous player's scratched ticket,
  and then leave the game with that ticket. The previous player then scratches his
  newly-acquired ticket and reveals its worth to everyone at the table."
- The game ends once all tickets have been scratched. All players still remaining
  at the table must leave with their currently-held tickets.
- 'Assume that each player uses the optimal strategy for maximizing the expected value
  of his ticket winnings. '
- Let E(<var>p</var>) represent the expected number of players left at the table when
  the game ends in a game consisting of <var>p</var> players (e.g. E(111) = 5.2912
  when rounded to 5 significant digits).
- "Let S<sub>1</sub>(<var>N</var>) = <img style=\"vertical-align:middle\" src=\"project/images/p444_sum.png\">
  E(<var>p</var>)<br>\r\nLet S<sub><var>k</var></sub>(<var>N</var>) = <img style=\"vertical-align:middle\"
  src=\"project/images/p444_sum.png\"> S<sub><var>k</var>-1</sub>(<var>p</var>) for
  <var>k</var> <img src=\"images/symbol_gt.gif\" width=\"10\" height=\"10\" alt=\"&gt;\"
  border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> 1"
- Find S<sub>20</sub>(10<sup>14</sup>) and write the answer in scientific notation
  rounded to 10 significant digits. Use a lowercase e to separate mantissa and exponent
  (e.g. S<sub>3</sub>(100) = 5.983679014e5).
