- "\r\nAn even positive integer N will be called admissible, if it is a power of 2
  or its distinct prime factors are consecutive primes.<br>\r\nThe first twelve admissible
  numbers are 2,4,6,8,12,16,18,24,30,32,36,48.\r\n"
- "\r\nIf N is admissible, the smallest integer M <img src=\"images/symbol_gt.gif\"
  width=\"10\" height=\"10\" alt=\"&gt;\" border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">
  1 such that N+M is prime, will be called the pseudo-Fortunate number for N.\r\n"
- "\r\nFor example, N=630 is admissible since it is even and its distinct prime factors
  are the consecutive primes 2,3,5 and 7.<br> \r\nThe next prime number after 631
  is 641; hence, the pseudo-Fortunate number for 630 is M=11.<br>\r\nIt can also be
  seen that the pseudo-Fortunate number for 16 is 3.\r\n"

  N less than 10<sup>9</sup>.\r\n"
